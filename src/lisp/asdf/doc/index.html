        <h3>ASDF 3</h3>
        <p>ASDF 3 is the current successor to Daniel Barlow's ASDF.
          It was rewritten for improved portability, robustness, usability,
          extensibility, configurability, internal consistency,
          and the ability to deliver standalone executables.
          It was pre-released as 2.27 on February 1st 2013,
          released as 3.0.0 on May 15th 2013,
          and again as 3.1.2 on May 6th 2014.
        </p>
        <a id="what_it_is"></a>
        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>ASDF stands for <em>A</em>nother <em>S</em>ystem <em>D</em>efinition <em>F</em>acility,
          in the continuity of the Lisp <tt>DEFSYSTEM</tt> of yore.
        </p>
        <p>ASDF 3 contains two parts: <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt> and <tt>uiop</tt>.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><tt>asdf/defsystem</tt></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>is a tool to describe how Lisp source code is organized in systems,
              and how to build a system in term of actions that depend on previous actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typical actions consist in compiling a Lisp source file (if not up to date)
              and loading the resulting compilation output (if not both loaded and up to date).
              And you must typically compile and load files that define packages, macros, variables,
              before you may compile and load other files that use them.
            </p>
            <p>It is roughly what Common Lisp hackers use to build and load software
              where C hackers might use GNU <tt>Make</tt> to build software and
              <tt>ld.so</tt> to load it.
            </p>
            <p><tt>asdf/defsystem</tt> is the part that people usually refer to as <tt>ASDF</tt>,
              with <tt>uiop</tt> being only a supporting library,
              that happens to be distributed at the same time, by necessity.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt><tt>uiop</tt></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>also known as <tt>asdf/driver</tt>,
              the Utilities for Implementation- and OS- Portability,
              is a Common Lisp portability library and runtime support system
              that helps you write Common Lisp software in a portable way.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to many general-purpose Lisp utilities,
              it notably provides portable abstractions to
              gloss over implementation quirks, support hot-upgrade of code,
              manipulate pathnames, create programs, use command-line arguments,
              access the environment, use the filesystem,
              call other programs and parse their output,
              compile Lisp code, muffle conditions, or configure Lisp software.
              See its
              <a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/asdf/asdf.git;a=blob;f=uiop/README;hb=HEAD;js=1">README</a>.
            </p>
            <p><tt>uiop</tt> is distributed as part of the <tt>ASDF</tt>,
              its source code is transcluded in the single-file <tt>asdf.lisp</tt> being distributed
              and the precompiled fasls provided by Lisp implementations.
              <tt>ASDF</tt> relies heavily on it for its portability layer and runtime support,
              particularly so as to handle pathnames and filesystem access.
              <tt>uiop</tt> is useful on its own and can also be compiled and distributed separately.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <a id="what_it_is_not"></a>
        <h3>What it is not</h3>
        <p>ASDF will <em>not</em> download missing software components for you.
          For that, you want <a href="http://quicklisp.org/"><tt>Quicklisp</tt></a>,
          that builds upon ASDF, and is great for pulling and installing
          tarballs of packages you may depend upon;
          we also recommend <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/"><tt>clbuild</tt></a>,
          that now builds upon Quicklisp, as a great tool for pulling from version control
          packages you need to modify or want to contribute to.
          We recommend you should <em>not</em> use <tt>asdf-install</tt> anymore,
          as it is an older similar piece of software that is both unmaintained and obsolete.
        </p><p>
          ASDF is also not a tool to build or run Common Lisp software from the Unix command-line.
          For that, you want <a href="http://cliki.net/cl-launch">cl-launch</a>,
          or perhaps <a href="http://www.xach.com/lisp/buildapp/">buildapp</a>.
        </p><p>
          If you're unsatisfied with ASDF,
          beside helping with our
          <a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/asdf/asdf.git;a=blob;f=TODO">TODO list</a>,
          you might be interested in other build systems for Common-Lisp:
          <ul>
            <li>Alastair Bridgewater's small and simple one-package-per-file
              <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/asdf/+bug/1230368"><tt>quick-build</tt></a>
              (also reimplemented as the ASDF extension
              <a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/asdf/asdf-package-system.git"
                 ><tt>asdf-package-system</tt></a>; similar to <tt>faslpath</tt> below).
            </li>
            <li>Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau's
              <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/xcvb/"><tt>XCVB</tt></a>
              (building object and image files deterministically and in parallel,
              but not actively maintained since 2012;
              thanks to its new build model, ASDF 3 could conceivably be modified
              to support these features).
            </li>
            <li>Drew McDermott's
              <a href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/"><tt>YTools</tt></a>
              (the polar opposite, trying to maintain coherence
              of the current Lisp image at a fine grain).
            </li>
            <li>Dmitriy Ivanov's
              <a href="http://lisp.ystok.ru/asdlite/"><tt>ASDlite</tt></a>
              (a somewhat improved incompatible variant of ASDF 1, less featureful than ASDF 3),
            </li>
            <li>Mark Kantrowitz's
              <a href="http://www.cliki.net/mk-defsystem"><tt>mk-defsystem</tt></a>
              (free software successor of the old proprietary DEFSYSTEM's
              and predecessor of ASDF, obsolete),
            </li>
            <li>Sean Ross's
              <a href="http://sean-ross.blogspot.com/search/label/mudballs"><tt>mudballs</tt></a>
              (an attempt at making things cleaner than in ASDF 2, aborted),
            </li>
            <li>Peter von Etter's
              <a href="http://www.cliki.net/faslpath"><tt>faslpath</tt></a>
              (a much simpler system establishing a mapping between packages and files,
              abandoned but see <tt>asdf-package-system</tt> and <tt>quick-build</tt> above).
            </li>
            <li>Alexander Kahl's
              <a href="http://www.cliki.net/evol"><tt>evol</tt></a>
              (a reimplementation in Lisp of the GNU autotools stack, abandoned),
            </li>
          </ul>
          There are probably more.
          However, none of these systems seems to ever have had the traction of ASDF,
          probably because none was technically superior enough (when at all)
          to compensate for the first mover advantage.
        </p>
        <h3>Supported Implementations</h3>
        <p>ASDF 3 now supports all CL implementations
          that seem to have any current user base, and then some.
        </p><p>
          Most implementations provide ASDF as a module,
          and you can simply <tt>(require "asdf")</tt>.
          (All of them but CLISP also accept
          <tt>:asdf</tt>, <tt>"ASDF"</tt> or <tt>'asdf</tt> as an argument.)
          Most of these implementations provide ASDF 3,
          a few only provide ASDF 2.
          Some implementations don't provide ASDF yet,
          but have announced they will in their next release.
          As for remaining implementations,
          they are obsolete and/or mostly unmaintained;
          still ASDF 3 supports them if you load it manually,
          though there might never be a next release
          to provide it through <tt>require</tt>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To deal with an implementation that doesn't yet provide ASDF 3,
          we provide <a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/asdf/asdf.git;a=blob;f=bin/install-asdf-as-module">a script</a> that can install ASDF 3
          where your implementation goes looking for it
          when you <tt>require</tt> it.
          Alternatively, if the implementation provides ASDF 2 or an older ASDF 3,
          you can download, install and configure a more recent ASDF 3,
          and use <tt>(asdf:load-system :asdf)</tt> to upgrade it.
          Beware: when upgrading from ASDF 2, you should always do it
          immediately after the <tt>require</tt>,
          and before you use ASDF for anything else
          (ASDF 3 does that automatically).

		 ><tt>asdf-flv</tt></a>,
	    to bind file-local variables around the compilation of some files.</li>
          <li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/asdf/asdf-package-system.git"
                 ><tt>asdf-package-system</tt></a>,
            to compile Lisp source files with one package per file
            that also determines dependencies, in the style of
            <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/asdf/+bug/1230368"><tt>quick-build</tt></a> or
            <a href="http://www.cliki.net/faslpath"><tt>faslpath</tt></a>
            (this functionality is built into recent versions of ASDF 3.1 and later,
            but this package exists for backward compatibility with earlier versions of ASDF 3;
            search the manual for <tt>package-inferred-system</tt>).
        </ul>
        <p>Former extensions, now superseded, include:</p>
        <ul>
	  <li><tt>asdf-binary-locations</tt> allowed one to redirect where ASDF creates its output files,
            so they don't clash between implementations and don't pollute source directories.
            It is superseded by <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt>'s builtin
            <tt>asdf-output-translations</tt> mechanism;
            a limited compatibility mode is available to easily convert
            your former ABL configuration into an AOT configuration.
            <tt>common-lisp-controller</tt> and <tt>cl-launch</tt> used to provide similar mechanisms,
            and have also been superseded by <tt>asdf-output-translations</tt>.
          </li>
	  <li><tt>asdf-bundle</tt>, n&eacute;e <tt>asdf-ecl</tt>,
            allowed you to create a single-file bundle out of a system,
            for easier delivery.
            It is now a builtin part of <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt>,
            and allows to deliver a single FASL for a system,
            or (on supported implementations), a standalone executable program,
            or an image containing part of your software precompiled.
          </li>
	  <li><tt>asdf-utils</tt> was a collection of utilities that originated with ASDF.
            It is now superseded by <tt>uiop</tt>, aka <tt>asdf/driver</tt>,
            which is part of ASDF,
            and exports its functionality
            in its own package <tt>uiop</tt>.
          </li>
	  <li><tt>asdf-condition-control</tt>, initially part of XCVB's <tt>xcvb-driver</tt>,
            allowed you to muffle uninteresting conditions during compilation.
            Is now superseded by equivalent functionality in <tt>uiop</tt>.
          </li>

        <h3>What is happening</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>July 2013 to May 2014</dt>
          <dd>Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau has resigned as maintainer
            but remained an active developer.
            Robert P. Goldman is interim maintainer until someone more gifted,
            charming, dedicated, and better-looking can be secured to fill the role.
            ASDF 3.0.2 was released in July 2013, 3.0.3 in October 2013, and 3.1.2 in May 2014.
            In addition to significant improvements and bug fixes,
            notably better Windows support,
            ASDF 3.1.2 notably sports the <tt>package-inferred-system</tt> extension.
          </dd>
          <dt>November 2012 to June 2013</dt>
          <dd>
            Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau completely rewrites ASDF
            and publishes ASDF 3, pre-released as 2.27 in February 2013,
            and released as 3.0.1 in May 2013.
            It now includes both the traditional <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt>
            and a formalized portability library <tt>uiop</tt> (n&eacute;e <tt>asdf/driver</tt>).
            <tt>asdf/defsystem</tt> is a backward-compatible reimplementation of ASDF
            with correct timestamp propagation based on a consistent dependency model,
            and featuring support for bundle output, deferred warnings check, and more.
            <tt>uiop</tt> provides many abstractions to write portable Common Lisp programs.
            Last version: 3.0.1.
          </dd>
          <dt>December 2009 to October 2012</dt>
          <dd>Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau is de facto maintainer,
            with notable contributions from Robert P. Goldman, but also
            Juanjo Garcia-Ripoll and James Anderson.
            ASDF 2.000 is released in May 2010
            with many clean-ups, better configurability, some new features,
            and updated documentation.
            The ASDF 2 series culminates with ASDF 2.26 in October 2012,
            which in addition to many bug fixes and small features
            includes support for file encodings, around-compile and compile-check hooks.
            Last version: 2.26.
          </dd>
          <dt>May 2006 to November 2009</dt>

            with notable contributions from
            Robert P. Goldman, Nikodemus Siivola, Christophe Rhodes, Daniel Herring.
            Many small features and bug fixes,
            making the project more maintainable,
            moving to using git and common-lisp.net.
            Last version: 1.369.
          </dd>
          <dt>May 2004 to April 2006</dt>

            The system made slightly more robust, a few more features.
            Last version: 1.97.
          </dd>
          <dt>August 2001 to May 2004</dt>
          <dd>Created then developed by Daniel Barlow, with notable contributions from
