;;; COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS
;;;
;;; This part is a source of problems because we have to access slots of
;;; various objects, which could potentially lead to infinite recursion as
;;; those accessors require also some dispatch. The solution is to avoid
;;; calling then generic function that implement the accessors.
;;; This is possible because:
;;;   1. The user can only extend compute-applicable-methods if it
;;;      defines a method with a subclass of standard-generic-function
;;;   2. The user cannot extend slot-value and friends on standard-classes
;;;      due to the restriction "Any method defined by a portable program
;;;      on a specified generic function must have at least one specializer
;;;      that is neither a specified class nor an eql specializer whose
;;;      associated value is an instance of a specified class."
;;;   3. Subclasses of specified classes preserve the slot order in ECL.
