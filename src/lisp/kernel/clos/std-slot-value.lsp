;;; SLOTS READING AND WRITING
;;;
;;; Functional and macro interface for accessing the slots of an instance.
;;; This interface is defined with specialization for classes that ECL
;;; knows of such as standard classes and funcallable standard class.
;;; This is needed to avoid circularity in compute-applicable-methods,
;;; which needs the slot values and thus cannot go through a dispatch
;;; itself.
;;;
;;; Note that using SLOT-VALUE or specialized versions of it is not
;;; wrong because the MOP enforces various restrictions on portable
;;; code:
;;;  1) Accessors must behave as SLOT-VALUE
;;;  2) In particular, any method defined by the user must be
;;;     specialized on at least one non-specified class. This means
;;;     that the user cannot change the behavoir of SLOT-VALUE for
;;;     standard classes.
;;;
;;; First of all we define WITH-SLOTS because it is going to be useful
;;; for enforcing the use of SLOT-VALUE and not of accessors
;;; throughout the bootstrap code.
