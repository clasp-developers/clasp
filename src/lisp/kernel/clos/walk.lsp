;;; A simple code walker, based IN PART on: (roll the credits)

;;;   Larry Masinter's simple code walker
;;;   .
;;;   .
;;;   boy, thats fair (I hope).
;;;
;;; For now at least, this code walker really only does what PCL needs it to
;;; do.  Maybe it will grow up someday.
;;;

;;;
;;; This code walker used to be completely portable.  Now it is just "Real
;;; easy to port".  This change had to happen because the hack that made it
;;; completely portable kept breaking in different releases of different
;;; Common Lisps, and in addition it never worked entirely anyways.  So,
;;; its now easy to port.  To port this walker, all you have to write is one
;;; simple macro and two simple functions.  These macros and functions are
;;; used by the walker to manipluate the macroexpansion environments of
;;; the Common Lisp it is running in.
;;;
;;; The code which implements the macroexpansion environment manipulation
;;; mechanisms is in the first part of the file, the real walker follows it.
;;; 

;;;
;;; The user entry points are walk-form and nested-walked-form.  In addition,
;;; it is legal for user code to call the variable information functions:
;;; variable-lexical-p, variable-special-p and variable-class.  Some users
;;; will need to call define-walker-template, they will have to figure that
;;; out for themselves.

;;; On the following pages are implementations of the implementation specific
;;; environment hacking functions.
;;;
;;; This code just hacks 'macroexpansion environments'.  That is, it is only
;;; concerned with the function binding of symbols in the environment.  The
;;; walker needs to be able to tell if the symbol names a lexical macro or
;;; function, and it needs to be able to build environments which contain
;;; lexical macro or function bindings.  It must be able, when walking a
;;; macrolet, flet or labels form to construct an environment which reflects
;;; the bindings created by that form.  Note that the environment created
;;; does NOT have to be sufficient to evaluate the body, merely to walk its
;;; body.  This means that definitions do not have to be supplied for lexical
;;; functions, only the fact that that function is bound is important.  For
;;; macros, the macroexpansion function must be supplied.
;;;
;;; This code is organized in a way that lets it work in implementations that
;;; stack cons their environments.  That is reflected in the fact that the
;;; only operation that lets a user build a new environment is a with-body
;;; macro which executes its body with the specified symbol bound to the new
;;; environment.  No code in this walker or in PCL will hold a pointer to
;;; these environments after the body returns.  Other user code is free to do
;;; so in implementations where it works, but that code is not considered
;;; portable.
;;;
;;; There are 3 environment hacking tools.  One macro which is used for
;;; creating new environments, and two functions which are used to access the
;;; bindings of existing environments.

;;;;;; Handling of special forms (the infamous 24).
  ;;
;;;
;;; and I quote...
;;; 
;;;     The set of special forms is purposely kept very small because
;;;     any program analyzing program (read code walker) must have
;;;     special knowledge about every type of special form. Such a
;;;     program needs no special knowledge about macros...
;;;
;;; So all we have to do here is a define a way to store and retrieve
;;; templates which describe how to walk the 24 special forms and we are all
;;; set...
;;;
;;; Well, its a nice concept, and I have to admit to being naive enough that
;;; I believed it for a while, but not everyone takes having only 24 special
;;; forms as seriously as might be nice.  There are (at least) 3 ways to
;;; lose:
;;
;;;   1 - Implementation x implements a Common Lisp special form as a macro
;;;       which expands into a special form which:
;;;         - Is a common lisp special form (not likely)
;;;         - Is not a common lisp special form (on the 3600 IF --> COND).
;;;
;;;     * We can safe ourselves from this case (second subcase really) by
;;;       checking to see if there is a template defined for something
;;;       before we check to see if we we can macroexpand it.
;;;
;;;   2 - Implementation x implements a Common Lisp macro as a special form.
;;;
;;;     * This is a screw, but not so bad, we save ourselves from it by
;;;       defining extra templates for the macros which are *likely* to
;;;       be implemented as special forms.  (DO, DO* ...)
;;;
;;;   3 - Implementation x has a special form which is not on the list of
;;;       Common Lisp special forms.
;;;
;;;     * This is a bad sort of a screw and happens more than I would like
;;;       to think, especially in the implementations which provide more
;;;       than just Common Lisp (3600, Xerox etc.).
;;;       The fix is not terribly staisfactory, but will have to do for
;;;       now.  There is a hook in get walker-template which can get a
;;;       template from the implementation's own walker.  That template
;;;       has to be converted, and so it may be that the right way to do
;;;       this would actually be for that implementation to provide an
;;;       interface to its walker which looks like the interface to this
;;;       walker.

;;; Here are some examples of the kinds of things you should be able to do
;;; with your implementation of the macroexpansion environment hacking
;;; mechanism.
;;; 
;;; with-lexical-macros is kind of like macrolet, but it only takes names
;;; of the macros and actual macroexpansion functions to use to macroexpand
;;; them.  The win about that is that for macros which want to wrap several
;;; macrolets around their body, they can do this but have the macroexpansion
;;; functions be compiled.  See the WITH-RPUSH example.
;;;
;;; If the implementation had a special way of communicating the augmented
;;; environment back to the evaluator that would be totally great.  It would
;;; mean that we could just augment the environment then pass control back
;;; to the implementations own compiler or interpreter.  We wouldn't have
;;; to call the actual walker.  That would make this much faster.  Since the
;;; principal client of this is defmethod it would make compiling defmethods
;;; faster and that would certainly be a win.
