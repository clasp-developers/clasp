;;; INSTANCE UPDATE PROTOCOL
;;;
;;;
;;; PART 1: CHANGING THE CLASS OF AN INSTANCE
;;;
;;; The method CHANGE-CLASS performs most of the work.
;;;
;;;	a) The structure of the instance is changed to match the new
;;;	   number of local slots.
;;;	b) The new local slots are filled with the value of the old
;;;	   slots. Only the name is used, so that a new local slot may
;;;	   get the value of old slots that were eithe local or shared.
;;;	c) Finally, UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-DIFFERENT-CLASS is invoked
;;;	   with a copy of the instance as it looked before the change,
;;;	   the changed instance and enough information to perform any
;;;	   extra processing.

;;; PART 2: UPDATING AN INSTANCE THAT BECAME OBSOLETE
;;;
;;; Each instance has a hidden field (readable with SI::INSTANCE-SIG), which
;;; contains the list of slots of its class. This field is updated every time
;;; the class is initialized or reinitialized. Generally
;;;	(EQ (SI::INSTANCE-SIG x) (CLASS-SLOTS (CLASS-OF x)))
;;; returns NIL whenever the class became obsolete.
;;;
;;; There are two circumstances under which a instance may become obsolete:
;;; either the class has been modified using REDEFINE-INSTANCE (and thus the
;;; list of slots changed), or MAKE-INSTANCES-OBSOLETE has been used.
;;;
;;; The function UPDATE-INSTANCE (hidden to the user) does the job of
;;; updating an instance that has become obsolete.
;;;
;;;	a) A copy of the instance is saved to check the old values.
;;;	b) The structure of the instance is changed to match the new
;;;	   number of local slots.
;;;	c) The new local slots are filled with the value of the old
;;;	   local slots.
;;;	d) Finally, UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS is invoked
;;;	   with enough information to perform any extra initialization,
;;;	   for instance of new slots.
;;;
;;; It is not clear when the function UPDATE-INSTANCE is invoked. At least
;;; this will happen whenever the functions SLOT-VALUE, (SETF SLOT-VALUE),
;;; SLOT-BOUNDP or SLOT-EXISTS-P are used.
