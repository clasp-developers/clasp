;;; This stuff constructs a form that is like an effective method function,
;;; except some method calls may be replaced by forms.
;;; These forms are produced using the PATCH-LIST, an alist of method->function.
;;; When a CALL-METHOD for a given method would be made, instead the function
;;; is called (along with some user parameters).

;;; :around and other primary methods could change the parameters passed to
;;; a known method, so they invalidate the whole project.
;;; Technically, we could allow LESS-specific primary methods, which would be
;;; called by whatever method we're worrying about... but given we're doing
;;; this for standard functions there's no chance of that.
;;; TODO?: If we tracked whether methods use complex call-next-method
;;; (i.e., anything with it beyond (call-next-method)) we could work with
;;; primary and :around methods as long as they didn't use complex c-n-m.

This version uses macrolet of call-method. It works, but it's harder to read
the results... and for no good reason, since it only works with the primary
method combination anyway.

To work with general method combinations, all I can think of is having
the CALL-METHOD macro somehow "signal" that we should give up, but
macroexpansion happens too late for that.
