;;; Generic function dispatch compiler
;;;   This implements the algorithm described by Robert Strandh for fast generic function dispatch
;;;
;;;   clos:generic-function-call-history is an alist of (past-call-signature . effective-method-closure)
;;;      The effective-method-closure is generated by combin.lsp:combine-method-functions3 and
;;;        the fptr always points to combin.lsp:combine-method-functions3.lambda
;;;        and is closed over the method and the rest-methods.
;;;      The past-call-signature is a simple-vector of classes for class-specializers
;;;        or (list eql-spec) for eql specializers.  The CAR of eql-spec is the EQL value and the
;;;        argument passed to the generic function.
;;;        eql-spec is the result of calling spec_type.unsafe_cons()->memberEql(spec_position_arg)
;;;          in the function fill_spec_vector.
