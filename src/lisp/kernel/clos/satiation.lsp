;;; Satiation of generic functions to start fastgf
;;;
;;; Ideas copied from Sicl/Code/CLOS/satiation.lisp
;;;

;;; Essentially, for some gfs we need in a consistent state for the system to work,
;;; during boot we fake a call history so that they can be called without invoking
;;; gfs such as themselves that haven't yet been placed in a working state.

;;; Satiation should occur before any generic function calls are performed, and
;;; involve no generic function calls, therefore.

;;; Note that the accessors for call-history and specializer-profile are not accessors,
;;; they are C++ functions. So they're okay to use without early-accessors.
