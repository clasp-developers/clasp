;;; Satiation of generic functions to start fastgf
;;;
;;; Ideas copied from Sicl/Code/CLOS/satiation.lisp
;;;

;;; Essentially, for some gfs we need in a consistent state for the system to work,
;;; during boot we fake a call history so that they can be called without invoking
;;; gfs such as themselves that haven't yet been placed in a working state.
;;; A fake call history is also nice for efficiency - if we install an anticipated
;;; history beforehand, we can avoid repeatedly compiling new discriminators.

;;; In order to do things both at boot and in an exported interface, we duplicate
;;; some code. Unfortunate but I don't see a good way to avoid it.

;;; BOOT-TIME SATIATION

;;; Satiation should occur before any generic function calls are performed, and
;;; involve no generic function calls.

;;; Note that the accessors for call-history and specializer-profile are not accessors,
;;; they are C++ functions. So they're okay to use without early-accessors.
