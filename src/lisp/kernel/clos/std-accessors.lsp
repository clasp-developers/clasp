;;; ACCESSOR / READER / WRITER METHOD CREATION
;;;
;;; The following code creates optimized and unoptimized versions of the
;;; slot accessors defined for a class. They are designed so that at least
;;; some varieties work at boot time.
;;; 

(defun safe-slot-definition-location (slotd &optional default)
  (cond ((listp slotd)
	 (error "List instead of a slot definition object"))
	(t
	 (slot-value slotd 'location))))

;;; The following does not get as fast as it should because we are not
;;; allowed to memoize the position of a slot. The problem is that the
;;; AMOP specifies that slot accessors are created from the direct
;;; slots, without knowing the slot position. This semantics is
;;; required for working standard-reader- and
;;; standard-writer-method. OTOH if we want to have memoized slot
;;; positions we have to work from the effective slots and we have to
;;; create methods for all slots, not only the direct ones in this
;;; class. Both semantics are incompatible, but we currently have no
;;; safe way to choose one or another
