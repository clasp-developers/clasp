;;; The trick is that everything flows from +global-environment+, and there is no real way to
;;; look up anything - including the symbol value of +global-environment+! - without it. I
;;; believe in SICL the plan is to provide a few things like +global-environment+ as arguments
;;; to the FASL run function, but clasp's loader does not work that way.
;;; Along with function-cell, what I do instead is resolve references to those using the old
;;; global machinery of symbol-value- and fdefinition- ast. More ideally, they should only be
;;; special-cased within load-time-value, but this is hard to pull off with the ltv architecture.

;;; The right way to do it might be to have function-cell-read and get-environment AST/instructions
;;; that only work in ltv context. For example, the loader could put the environment and
;;; #'sicl-genv:function-cell in the first two slots of the ltv vector before doing anything else,
;;; and then the instructions just read those slots.
