;;; Macro SHIFTF.
;;;
;;; If there is a single place, i.e. the form looks like this:
;;;
;;;     (SHIFTF <place> <new-value-form>)
;;;
;;; then we generate the following expansion:
;;;
;;;     (LET* <bindings>
;;;       (PROG1 <accessing-form>
;;;         (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND <store-variables> <new-value-form>
;;;           <storing-form>)))
;;;
;;; where <bindings> are the bindings of temporary variables to values
;;; of sub-forms of <place>, <accessing-form> is the accessing form of
;;; <place>, <store-variables> are the store variables of <place>, and
;;; <storing-form> is the storing form of <place>.
;;;
;;; If there is more than one place, i.e the form looks like this:
;;;
;;;     (SHIFT <place1> <place2> ... <placen> <new-value-form>)
;;;
;;; then we generate the following expansion:
;;;
;;;     (LET* <bindings1>
;;;       (PROG1 <accessing-form1>
;;;         (LET* <bindings2>
;;;           (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND <store-variables1> <accessing-form2>
;;;             ...
