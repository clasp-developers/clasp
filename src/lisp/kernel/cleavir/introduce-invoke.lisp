;;;; We do not introduce any LANDING-PAD instruction.  The reason for
;;;; that is that it would create an incorrect control flow in the
;;;; flowchart.  Take for instance the following code:
;;;;
;;;;    (tagbody 
;;;;       (ff (lambda () (go a)) (lambda () (go b)))
;;;;     a
;;;;       (print 'a)
;;;;       (go out)
;;;;     b
;;;;       (print 'b)
;;;;     out)
;;;;
;;;; The (GO A) form generates an UNWIND-INSTRUCTION having the form
;;;; (PRINT 'A) as its successor, and the (GO B) form generates an
;;;; UNWIND-INSTRUCTION having the form (PRINT 'B) as its successor If
;;;; we use a LANDING-PAD instruction with (PRINT 'A) and (PRINT 'B)
;;;; as its successors, then we give the false impression that there
;;;; is a possible control flow from (GO A) to (PRINT 'B) and vice
;;;; versa.
;;;;
;;;; So we keep the graph as it is, but we convert some
;;;; FUNCALL-INSTRUCTIONs to INVOKE-INSTRUCTIONs and each
;;;; INVOKE-INSTRUCTION contains the unique landing pad for the
;;;; function.

;;; Return a list of all the UNWIND-INSTRUCTIONs in a program
;;; represented as a flowchart.
