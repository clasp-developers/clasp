;;; Note: Previously, we had cleanup blocks in almost every function, which popped a "shadow stack"
;;; loaded with arguments for the debugger. Stackmaps mean we no longer have to do that, but similar
;;; code may be useful for inlining UNWIND-PROTECT.
;;; Essentially it worked as follows: We'd bind some special variables with exn.slot, ehselector.slot,
;;; a cleanup landing pad, and the cleanup block that succeded the pad. The landing pad would be used
;;; for basically all calls (requiring them to be INVOKEs), and also passed to
;;; generate-catch-landing-pad with the others. If there was a cleanup pad, the catch's pad would be
;;; marked as a cleanup (you can still see this code above) and during an exit would branch to the
;;; cleanup block. All pads in the function would share ehselector and exn slots so that they could
;;; all go to the same cleanup block and thus the same resume.
