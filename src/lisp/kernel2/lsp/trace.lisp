"Syntax: (trace ({function-name | ({function-name}+)} {keyword [form|(form*)]}*)
Begins tracing the specified functions.  With no FUNCTION-NAMEs, returns a
list of functions currently being traced. The printed information consists of
the name of function followed at entry by its arguments and on exit by its
return values.
The keywords allow to control when and how tracing is performed.
The possible keywords are:

 :BREAK		a breakpoint is entered after printing the entry trace
		information, but before applying the traced function to its
		arguments, if form evaluates to non-nil
 :BREAK-AFTER 	like :BREAK but the breakpoint is entered after the function
		has been executed and the exit trace information has been
		printed and before control returns
 :COND-BEFORE	information is printed upon entry if form evaluates to non-nil
 :COND-AFTER	information is printed upon exit if form evaluates to non-nil
 :COND		specifies a single condition for both entry and exit
 :PRINT		prints the values of the forms in the list upon entry.
		They are preceeded by a backslash (\\)
 :PRINT-AFTER	prints the values of the forms in the list upon exit from the
		function. They are preceeded by a backslash (\\)
 :STEP		turns on the stepping facility

Forms can refer to the list of arguments of the function through the variable
SI::ARGS."
