# Clasp â€” Bringing Common Lisp and C++ Together

## NOTE:  November 28, 2018 - This contains a pre-release of Clasp 0.9.

[We have a new talk up on youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbdXeRBbgDM&feature=youtu.be)

##  Overview
Clasp is a new [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/) implementation that seamlessly interoperates with C++ libraries and programs using [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) for compilation to native code. This allows Clasp to take advantage of a vast array of preexisting libraries and programs, such as out of the scientific computing ecosystem. Embedding them in a Common Lisp environment allows you to make use of rapid prototyping, incremental development, and other capabilities that make it a powerful language.

## Latest Release
The upcoming release is [Clasp 0.9](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/releases/tag/0.9.0). [Changes](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/milestone/3)

See the [RELEASE-NOTES](RELEASE-NOTES)

### Building Clasp
At the moment, Clasp is supported on Linux, Mac OS X and FreeBSD. On these systems, you should be able to build it from source. 

[Follow the instructions.](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/wiki/Build-Instructions)

In case things go wrong, the quickest way to get help is to either [file an issue](#reporting-problems), or to [chat with us directly](#irc).

Building takes a lot of resources.  In parallel mode
('USE_PARALLEL_BUILD = True' in wscript.config)
you will not be able to survive with only 8 GB of RAM and it will be 1-2 hours build time.
If you have 8 GB of RAM you can turn off the parallel build which will then run for a day or so.  Make sure to have some paging space ("swapfile") configured.

There is a docker image for a superset of Clasp called [Cando](https://hub.docker.com/r/drmeister/cando/)

Currently there are no binary releases available, however you can extract a working /opt/clasp tree for Debian 10 out of the docker image.


### Common Lisp Ecosystem Support
Clasp supports the following major components:

* [SLIME](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/)
* [ASDF](https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/)
* [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)
* [CFFI](https://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/)
* [Bordeaux-Threads](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/163)
* [Unicode](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/164)

Post on the issues or [contact us](#irc) if you're interested in changing that.

## Contributing to Clasp
We very much welcome any kind of contribution to Clasp, even if it is just bug finding and testing. A lot can be done all around the project, if you want to dive into something large. See the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for the few guidelines we've set up around contributions.

## Reporting Problems
Generally you can report problems in two fashions, either by [opening an issue ticket](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/new) or by [chatting with us directly](#irc). In both cases, though, you should have the following pieces handy in order for us to be able to help you out as quickly and painlessly as possible:

* Your operating system name and version.
* The branches that you're using of Clasp and Externals-Clasp.
* A paste of the build log or failure point that you reached.
* Patience.

## IRC
Clasp has an IRC channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) called [#clasp](irc://irc.freenode.net/#clasp). If you have questions, problems, suggestions, or generally would like to just hang out with us devs, come and stop by!
