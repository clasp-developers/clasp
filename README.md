# Clasp â€” Bringing Common Lisp and C++ Together

Clasp is a new [Common Lisp][] implementation that seamlessly interoperates with 
C++ libraries and programs using [LLVM][] for compilation to native code. This 
allows Clasp to take advantage of a vast array of preexisting libraries and 
programs, such as out of the scientific computing ecosystem. Embedding them in a 
Common Lisp environment allows you to make use of rapid prototyping, incremental 
development, and other capabilities that make it a powerful language.

For more information on using Clasp, see:

* [Clasp Manual][]
* [clbind Documentation][]

## Releases

See [Releases][] for current releases of Clasp.  For more information please
see the [Release Notes][].

### Building Clasp

At the moment, Clasp is supported on Linux, Mac OS X and FreeBSD. On these 
systems, you should be able to build it from source and you may be able to
install using a package manager. See the [Wiki][] for more information.

In case things go wrong, the quickest way to get help is to either 
[file an issue](#reporting-problems), or to [chat with us directly](#irc).

Building takes a lot of resources.  In parallel mode
(`:parallel-build t` in config.sexp) you need more than 8 GB of RAM 
and it will be 1-2 hours build time. If you have 8 GB of RAM you can turn off 
the parallel build which will then run for a day or so.  Make sure to have some 
paging space ("swapfile") configured.

There is a docker image for a superset of Clasp called Cando at 
[Cando Docker][].

Currently there are no binary releases available, however you can extract a 
working /opt/clasp tree for Debian 10 out of the docker image.

### Common Lisp Ecosystem Support

Clasp supports the following major components:

* [SLIME](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/)
* [ASDF](https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/)
* [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)
* [CFFI](https://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/)
* [Bordeaux-Threads](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/163)
* [Unicode](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/164)

Post on the issues or [contact us](#irc) if you're interested in changing that.

## Contributing to Clasp

We very much welcome any kind of contribution to Clasp, even if it is just bug 
finding and testing. A lot can be done all around the project, if you want to 
dive into something large. See the [Contributing][] file for the few guidelines 
we've set up around contributions.

## Reporting Problems

Generally you can report problems in two fashions, either by opening a 
[New Issue][] or by [chatting with us directly](#irc). In both cases, though, 
you should have the following pieces handy in order for us to be able to help 
you out as quickly and painlessly as possible:

* Your operating system name and version.
* The branch that you're using of Clasp.
* A paste of the build log or failure point that you reached.
* Patience.

## IRC

Clasp has an IRC channel on [Libera][] called [#clasp][]. If you have questions, 
problems, suggestions, or generally would like to just hang out with us devs, 
come and stop by!
