[orte_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like orte_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during orte_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
Open MPI developer):

  %s failed
  --> Returned value %s (%d) instead of ORTE_SUCCESS
#
#
[orte:session:dir:prohibited]
The specified location for the temporary directories required by Open MPI
is on the list of prohibited locations:

Location given: %s
Prohibited locations: %s

If you believe this is in error, please contact your system administrator
to have the list of prohibited locations changed. Otherwise, please identify
a different location to be used (use -h to see the cmd line option), or
simply let the system pick a default location.
#
[orte:session:dir:nopwname]
Open MPI was unable to obtain the username in order to create a path
for its required temporary directories.  This type of error is usually
caused by a transient failure of network-based authentication services
(e.g., LDAP or NIS failure due to network congestion), but can also be
an indication of system misconfiguration.

Please consult your system administrator about these issues and try
again.
#
[orte_nidmap:file-cant-open]
Unable to open the file that was to contain the cluster's profile. The file
name we were given was:

FILE: %s

Please check to ensure this file exists and has appropriate read permissions.
#
[orte_nidmap:unable-read-file]
An error occurred while trying to read the file containing the cluster's profile.
The file we were reading was:

FILE: %s

Please check that this file was correctly generated.
#
[orte_nidmap:too_many_nodes]
An error occurred while trying to pack the information about the job. More nodes
have been found than the %d expected. Please check your configuration files such
as the mapping.
