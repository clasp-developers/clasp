[empty-nodelist-error]
There are not enough slots available in the Grid Engine 
Parallel Environment (PE) to satisfy the slot requirement needed to
launch ORTE daemons to the remote hosts, as requested by the application.

Either request fewer slots in application with less value in -np, 
or make more PE slots available for use.

[cannot-read-pe-hostfile]
The Grid Engine ras component is not able to read the $PE_HOSTFILE for
the Grid Engine nodes. The $PE_HOSTFILE environment variable shows the
file is located at:

  %s

The following error is returned:

  %s

[no-nodes-found]
No slots were found in the Grid Engine Parallel Environment (PE). This
is probably a setup issue, or could be due to a corrupted $PE_HOSTFILE.There is also a chance that you may not be running under a parallel job
environment (PE) -- you may have forgotten to specify this is a parallel
job. If so, please specify that to Grid Engine and try again.
