# This is the US/English general help file for the resilient mapper.
#
[orte-rmaps-resilient:file-not-found]
The specified file that describes the fault groups for this system:

FILE: %s

was not found. Please verify the file name and location.

[orte-rmaps-resilient:num-procs]
The resilient mapper requires that you specify the number of processes
to be launched for each application. Please provide the required information
and try again.

Alternatively, if you truly wish to take advantage of the -perxxx options
or to simply launch one process on every available slot, do not specify the
resilient mapper. Mpirun will automatically select the appropriate mapper
to support your request.
