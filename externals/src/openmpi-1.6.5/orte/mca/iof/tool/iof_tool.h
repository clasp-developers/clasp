 * The tool IOF component is used in tools. It is used
 * to interface to the HNP to request forwarding of stdout/err/diag
 * from any combination of procs, and to forward stdin from the
 * tool to a specified proc provided the user has allowed that
 * functionality.
 *
 * Flow control is employed on a per-stream basis to ensure that
 * SOURCEs don't overwhelm SINK resources (E.g., send an entire input
 * file to an orted before the target process has read any of it).
