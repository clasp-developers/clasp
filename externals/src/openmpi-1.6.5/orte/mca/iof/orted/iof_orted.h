/**

 *
 * The orted IOF component is used in daemons.  It is used
 * to orted all IOF actions back to the "hnp" IOF component (i.e., the
 * IOF component that runs in the HNP).  The orted IOF component is
 * loaded in an orted and then tied to the stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr streams of created child processes via pipes.  The orted
 * IOF component in the orted then acts as the relay between the
 * stdin/stdout/stderr pipes and the IOF component in the HNP.
 * This design allows us to manipulate stdin/stdout/stderr from before
 * main() in the child process.
 *
 * Much of the intelligence of this component is actually contained in
 * iof_base_endpoint.c (reading and writing to local file descriptors,
 * setting up events based on file descriptors, etc.).  
 *
 * A non-blocking OOB receive is posted at the initialization of this
 * component to receive all messages from the HNP (e.g., data
 * fragments from streams, ACKs to fragments).
 *
 * Flow control is employed on a per-stream basis to ensure that
 * SOURCEs don't overwhelm SINK resources (E.g., send an entire input
 * file to an orted before the target process has read any of it).
