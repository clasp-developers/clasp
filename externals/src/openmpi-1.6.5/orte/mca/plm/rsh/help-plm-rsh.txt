[no-local-orted]
The rsh PLS component was not able to find the executable "orted" in
your PATH or in the directory where Open MPI/OpenRTE was initially installed,
and therefore cannot continue.

For reference, your current PATH is:

  %s

We also looked for orted in the following directory:

  %s

[multiple-prefixes]
Specified multiple application contexts using different
settings for --prefix. Care should be taken, that corresponding
processes are mapped to different nodes. Having multiple prefixes
per node is not allowed.

The previously set prefix was
  %s

the prefix to be set overriding:
  %s

[concurrency-less-than-zero]
The value of the MCA parameter "pls_rsh_num_concurrent" is less than
or equal to zero (%d).  This parameter is used to determine how many
remote agents (typically rsh or ssh) to invoke concurrently while
launching parallel jobs.  

This value has automatically be reset to 1; processing will continue.

[deadlock-params]
The rsh launcher has been given a number of %d concurrent daemons to
launch and is in a debug-daemons option. However, the total number of
daemons to launch (%d) is greater than this value. This is a scenario that
will cause the system to deadlock.

To avoid deadlock, either increase the number of concurrent daemons, or
remove the debug-daemons flag.

[unknown-user]
The user (%d) is unknown to the system (i.e. there is no corresponding
entry in the password file). Please contact your system administrator
for a fix.
#
[cannot-resolve-shell-with-prefix]
The rsh launcher has been given a prefix to use, but could not determine
the type of remote shell being used on the remote node. This is a fatal
error as we cannot determine how to construct the cmd line to set your
remote LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH environmental variables.

The prefix we were given are:

opal_prefix: %s
prefix_dir: %s
