# This Makefile does not stand on its own; it is included in

# small number of files in the f77 directory so that they can be
# included in the main libmpi.  See comments in that Makefile.am for

# Note that the ordering of "." in SUBDIRS is important: the C++, F77,
# and F90 bindings are all in standalone .la files that depend on
# libmpi.la.  So we must fully build libmpi.la first.

# NOTE: A handful of files in mpi/f77/base must be included in
# libmpi.la.  But we wanted to keep all the Fortran sources together
# in the same tree, so we moved those sources to a separate
# subdirectory with its own Makefile.include that is included in this
# Makefile.am (NOTE: it did *not* work to put all the files -- base
# and non-base -- into mpi/f77 and have both a regular Makefile.am for
# building the f77 bindings library and a separate Makefile.include
# that was included in this top-level Makefile.am; problems occurred
# with "make distclean" and files in the ompi/mpi/f77/.deps directory
# -- it's not clear whether this is an AM bug or whether this behavior
# is simply not supported).  This ompi/mpi/f77/base/Makefile.include
# file makes a convenience LT library that is then sucked into
# libmpi.la (the ompi/mpi/f77/base sources must be compiled with
# special CPPFLAGS; we can't just add the raw sources to
# libmpi_la_SOURCES, unfortunately).

# The end of the result is that libmpi.la -- including a few sources
# from mpi/f77/base -- is fully built before the C++, F77, and F90
# bindings are built.  Therefore, the C++, F77 and F90 bindings
# libraries can all link against libmpi.la.
