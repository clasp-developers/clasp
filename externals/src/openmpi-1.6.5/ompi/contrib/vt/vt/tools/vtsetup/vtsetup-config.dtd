\e 	    The escape character ('\u001B')
\cx 	The control character corresponding to x
 
Character classes:

[abc] 	    	a, b, or c (simple class)
[^abc] 			Any character except a, b, or c (negation)
[a-zA-Z] 		a through z or A through Z, inclusive (range)
[a-d[m-p]] 		a through d, or m through p: [a-dm-p] (union)
[a-z&&[def]] 	d, e, or f (intersection)
[a-z&&[^bc]] 	a through z, except for b and c: [ad-z] (subtraction)
[a-z&&[^m-p]] 	a through z, and not m through p: [a-lq-z](subtraction)
 
Predefined character classes:

. 		Any character (may or may not match line terminators)
\d 		A digit: [0-9]
\D 		A non-digit: [^0-9]
\s 		A whitespace character: [ \t\n\x0B\f\r]
\S 		A non-whitespace character: [^\s]
\w 		A word character: [a-zA-Z_0-9]
\W 		A non-word character: [^\w]

 
POSIX character classes (US-ASCII only):

\p{Lower} 	A lower-case alphabetic character: [a-z]
\p{Upper} 	An upper-case alphabetic character:[A-Z]
\p{ASCII} 	All ASCII:[\x00-\x7F]
\p{Alpha} 	An alphabetic character:[\p{Lower}\p{Upper}]
\p{Digit} 	A decimal digit: [0-9]
\p{Alnum} 	An alphanumeric character:[\p{Alpha}\p{Digit}]
\p{Punct} 	Punctuation: One of !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
\p{Graph} 	A visible character: [\p{Alnum}\p{Punct}]
\p{Print} 	A printable character: [\p{Graph}]
\p{Blank} 	A space or a tab: [ \t]
\p{Cntrl} 	A control character: [\x00-\x1F\x7F]
\p{XDigit} 	A hexadecimal digit: [0-9a-fA-F]
\p{Space} 	A whitespace character: [ \t\n\x0B\f\r]

 
Classes for Unicode blocks and categories:

\p{InGreek} 			A character in the Greek block (simple block)
\p{Lu} 					An uppercase letter (simple category)
\p{Sc} 					A currency symbol
\P{InGreek} 			Any character except one in the Greek block (negation)
[\p{L}&&[^\p{Lu}]]  	Any letter except an uppercase letter (subtraction)
 

Boundary matchers:

^ 		The beginning of a line
$ 		The end of a line
\b 		A word boundary
\B 		A non-word boundary
\A 		The beginning of the input
\G 		The end of the previous match
\Z 		The end of the input but for the final terminator, if any
\z 		The end of the input

 
Greedy quantifiers:

X? 		X, once or not at all
X* 		X, zero or more times
X+ 		X, one or more times
X{n} 	X, exactly n times
X{n,} 	X, at least n times
X{n,m} 	X, at least n but not more than m times
 
 
Reluctant quantifiers:

X?? 		X, once or not at all
X*? 		X, zero or more times
X+? 		X, one or more times
X{n}? 		X, exactly n times
X{n,}? 		X, at least n times
X{n,m}? 	X, at least n but not more than m times
 
 
Possessive quantifiers:

X?+ 		X, once or not at all
X*+ 		X, zero or more times
X++ 		X, one or more times
X{n}+ 		X, exactly n times
X{n,}+ 		X, at least n times
X{n,m}+ 	X, at least n but not more than m times
 
 
Logical operators:

XY 		X followed by Y
X|Y 	Either X or Y
(X) 	X, as a capturing group
 
 
Back references:

\n 	Whatever the nth capturing group matched
 
 
Quotation:

\ 		Nothing, but quotes the following character
\Q 		Nothing, but quotes all characters until \E
\E 		Nothing, but ends quoting started by \Q

 
Special constructs (non-capturing):

(?:X) 					X, as a non-capturing group
(?idmsux-idmsux)  		Nothing, but turns match flags on - off
(?idmsux-idmsux:X)  	X, as a non-capturing group with the given flags on - off
(?=X) 					X, via zero-width positive lookahead
(?!X) 					X, via zero-width negative lookahead
(?<=X) 					X, via zero-width positive lookbehind
(?<!X) 					X, via zero-width negative lookbehind
(?>X) 					X, as an independent, non-capturing group
