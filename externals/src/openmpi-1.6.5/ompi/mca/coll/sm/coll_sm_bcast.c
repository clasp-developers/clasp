/**
 * Shared memory broadcast.
 *
 * For the root, the general algorithm is to wait for a set of
 * segments to become available.  Once it is, the root claims the set
 * by writing the current operation number and the number of processes
 * using the set to the flag.  The root then loops over the set of
 * segments; for each segment, it copies a fragment of the user's
 * buffer into the shared data segment and then writes the data size
 * into its childrens' control buffers.  The process is repeated until
 * all fragments have been written.
 *
 * For non-roots, for each set of buffers, they wait until the current
 * operation number appears in the in-use flag (i.e., written by the
 * root).  Then for each segment, they wait for a nonzero to appear
 * into their control buffers.  If they have children, they copy the
 * data from their parent's shared data segment into their shared data
 * segment, and write the data size into each of their childrens'
 * control buffers.  They then copy the data from their shared [local]
 * data segment into the user's output buffer.  The process is
 * repeated until all fragments have been received.  If they do not
 * have children, they copy the data directly from the parent's shared
 * data segment into the user's output buffer.
