      btl_openib_warn_no_device_params_found to 0.
#
[init-fail-no-mem]
The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL failed to initialize while trying to
allocate some locked memory.  This typically can indicate that the
memlock limits are set too low.  For most HPC installations, the
memlock limits should be set to "unlimited".  The failure occured
here:

  Local host:    %s
  OMPI source:   %s:%d
  Function:      %s()
  Device:        %s
  Memlock limit: %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.  This FAQ entry on the Open MPI web site may also be
helpful:

    http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ib-locked-pages
#
[init-fail-create-q]
The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL failed to initialize while trying to
create an internal queue.  This typically indicates a failed
OpenFabrics installation, faulty hardware, or that Open MPI is
attempting to use a feature that is not supported on your hardware
(i.e., is a shared receive queue specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter with a device that does not
support it?).  The failure occured here:

  Local host:  %s
  OMPI source: %s:%d
  Function:    %s()
  Error:       %s (errno=%d)
  Device:      %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.
#
[pp rnr retry exceeded]
The OpenFabrics "receiver not ready" retry count on a per-peer
connection between two MPI processes has been exceeded.  In general,
this should not happen because Open MPI uses flow control on per-peer
connections to ensure that receivers are always ready when data is
sent.

This error usually means one of two things:

1. There is something awry within the network fabric itself.  
2. A bug in Open MPI has caused flow control to malfunction.
 
#1 is usually more likely.  You should note the hosts on which this
error has occurred; it has been observed that rebooting or removing a
particular host from the job can sometimes resolve this issue.

Below is some information about the host that raised the error and the
peer to which it was connected:

  Local host:   %s
  Local device: %s
  Peer host:    %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.
#
[srq rnr retry exceeded]
The OpenFabrics "receiver not ready" retry count on a shared receive
queue or XRC receive queue has been exceeded.  This error can occur if
the mca_btl_openib_ib_rnr_retry is set to a value less than 7 (where 7
the default value and effectively means "infinite retry").  If your
rnr_retry value is 7, there might be something awry within the network
fabric itself.  In this case, you should note the hosts on which this
error has occurred; it has been observed that rebooting or removing a
particular host from the job can sometimes resolve this issue.

Below is some information about the host that raised the error and the
peer to which it was connected:

  Local host:   %s
  Local device: %s
  Peer host:    %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.
#
[pp retry exceeded]
The InfiniBand retry count between two MPI processes has been
exceeded.  "Retry count" is defined in the InfiniBand spec 1.2
(section 12.7.38):

    The total number of times that the sender wishes the receiver to
    retry timeout, packet sequence, etc. errors before posting a
    completion error.

This error typically means that there is something awry within the
InfiniBand fabric itself.  You should note the hosts on which this
error has occurred; it has been observed that rebooting or removing a
particular host from the job can sometimes resolve this issue.  

Two MCA parameters can be used to control Open MPI's behavior with
respect to the retry count:

* btl_openib_ib_retry_count - The number of times the sender will
  attempt to retry (defaulted to 7, the maximum value).
* btl_openib_ib_timeout - The local ACK timeout parameter (defaulted
  to 20).  The actual timeout value used is calculated as:

     4.096 microseconds * (2^btl_openib_ib_timeout)

  See the InfiniBand spec 1.2 (section 12.7.34) for more details.

Below is some information about the host that raised the error and the
peer to which it was connected:

  Local host:   %s
  Local device: %s
  Peer host:    %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.

[no active ports found]
WARNING: There is at least non-excluded one OpenFabrics device found,
but there are no active ports detected (or Open MPI was unable to use
them).  This is most certainly not what you wanted.  Check your
cables, subnet manager configuration, etc.  The openib BTL will be
ignored for this job.

  Local host: %s
#
[error in device init]
WARNING: There was an error initializing an OpenFabrics device.

  Local host:   %s
  Local device: %s
#
[no devices right type]
WARNING: No OpenFabrics devices of the right type were found within
the requested bus distance.  The OpenFabrics BTL will be ignored for
this run.

  Local host:     %s
  Requested type: %s

If the "requested type" is "<any>", this usually means that *no*
OpenFabrics devices were found within the requested bus distance.
#
[default subnet prefix]
WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host '%s', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-default-subnet-gid

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix to 0.

WARNING: fork() support was requested for the OpenFabrics (openib)
BTL, but it is not supported on the host %s.  Deactivating the
OpenFabrics BTL.
#
[ibv_fork_init fail]
WARNING: fork() support was requested for the OpenFabrics (openib)
BTL, but the library call ibv_fork_init() failed on the host %s.
Deactivating the OpenFabrics BTL.
#
[wrong buffer alignment]
Wrong buffer alignment %d configured on host '%s'. Should be bigger

Open MPI will try to continue, but the job may end up failing.

  Local host:        %s
  MPI process PID:   %d
  Error number:      %d

This error may indicate that you are using an OpenFabrics library
version that is not currently supported by Open MPI.  You might try
recompiling Open MPI against your OpenFabrics library installation to
get more information.
#
[specified include and exclude]
ERROR: You have specified more than one of the btl_openib_if_include,
btl_openib_if_exclude, btl_openib_ipaddr_include, or btl_openib_ipaddr_exclude
MCA parameters.  These four parameters are mutually exclusive; you can only
specify one.

For reference, the values that you specified are:

#
[no qps in receive_queues]
WARNING: No queue pairs were defined in the btl_openib_receive_queues
MCA parameter.  At least one queue pair must be defined.  The
OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore be deactivated for this run.

  Local host: %s
#
[invalid qp type in receive_queues]
WARNING: An invalid queue pair type was specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL
will be deactivated for this run.

Valid queue pair types are "P" for per-peer and "S" for shared receive
queue.

#
[invalid pp qp specification]
WARNING: An invalid per-peer receive queue specification was detected
as part of the btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  The
OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore be deactivated for this run.

Per-peer receive queues require between 2 and 5 parameters:

  1. Buffer size in bytes (mandatory)
  2. Number of buffers (mandatory)
  3. Low buffer count watermark (optional; defaults to (num_buffers / 2))
  4. Credit window size (optional; defaults to (low_watermark / 2))
  5. Number of buffers reserved for credit messages (optional;
     defaults to (num_buffers*2-1)/credit_window)

  Example: P,128,256,128,16
  - 128 byte buffers
  - 256 buffers to receive incoming MPI messages
  - When the number of available buffers reaches 128, re-post 128 more
    buffers to reach a total of 256
  - If the number of available credits reaches 16, send an explicit
    credit message to the sender
  - Defaulting to ((256 * 2) - 1) / 16 = 31; this many buffers are
    reserved for explicit credit messages

#
[invalid srq specification]
WARNING: An invalid shared receive queue specification was detected as
part of the btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  The OpenFabrics
(openib) BTL will therefore be deactivated for this run.

Shared receive queues can take between 2 and 6 parameters:

  1. Buffer size in bytes (mandatory)
  2. Number of buffers (mandatory)
  3. Low buffer count watermark (optional; defaults to (num_buffers / 2))
  4. Maximum number of outstanding sends a sender can have (optional;
     defaults to (low_watermark / 4)
  5. Start value of number of receive buffers that will be pre-posted (optional; defaults to (num_buffers / 4))
  6. Event limit buffer count watermark (optional; defaults to (3/16 of start value of buffers number))

  Example: S,1024,256,128,32,32,8
  - 1024 byte buffers
  - 256 buffers to receive incoming MPI messages
  - When the number of available buffers reaches 128, re-post 128 more
    buffers to reach a total of 256
  - A sender will not send to a peer unless it has less than 32
    outstanding sends to that peer.
  - 32 receive buffers will be preposted.
  - When the number of unused shared receive buffers reaches 8, more
    buffers (32 in this case) will be posted.

[rd_num must be > rd_low]
WARNING: The number of buffers for a queue pair specified via the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter must be greater than the low
buffer count watermark.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore
be deactivated for this run.

  Local host: %s

#
[rd_num must be >= rd_init]
WARNING: The number of buffers for a queue pair specified via the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter (parameter #2) must be
greater or equal to the initial SRQ size (parameter #5).
The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore be deactivated for this run.

  Local host: %s

#
[biggest qp size is too small]
WARNING: The largest queue pair buffer size specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter is smaller than the maximum
send size (i.e., the btl_openib_max_send_size MCA parameter), meaning
that no queue is large enough to receive the largest possible incoming
message fragment.  The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL will therefore be
deactivated for this run.

  Local host: %s
  Largest buffer size: %d
  Maximum send fragment size: %d
#
[biggest qp size is too big]
WARNING: The largest queue pair buffer size specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter is larger than the maximum
send size (i.e., the btl_openib_max_send_size MCA parameter).  This
means that memory will be wasted because the largest possible incoming
message fragment will not fill a buffer allocated for incoming
fragments.

  Local host: %s
  Largest buffer size: %d
  Maximum send fragment size: %d
#
[freelist too small]
WARNING: The maximum freelist size that was specified was too small
for the requested receive queue sizes.  The maximum freelist size must
be at least equal to the sum of the largest number of buffers posted
to a single queue plus the corresponding number of reserved/credit
buffers for that queue.  It is suggested that the maximum be quite a
bit larger than this for performance reasons.

#
[XRC with wrong OOB]
WARNING: You must use the "xoob" OpenFabrics (openib) connection
manager when XRC ("X") queues are specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter.  Either remove the X queues
from btl_openib_receive_queues or ensure to use the "xoob" connection
manager by setting btl_openib_connect to "xoob".  The OpenFabrics BTL
will therefore be deactivated for this run.

#
[locally conflicting receive_queues]
Open MPI detected two devices on a single server that have different
"receive_queues" parameter values (in the openib BTL).  Open MPI
currently only supports one OpenFabrics receive_queues value in an MPI
job, even if you have different types of OpenFabrics adapters on the
same host.

Device 2 (in the details shown below) will be ignored for the duration
of this MPI job.

You can fix this issue by one or more of the following:

  1. Set the MCA parameter btl_openib_receive_queues to a value that
     is usable by all the OpenFabrics devices that you will use.
  2. Use the btl_openib_if_include or btl_openib_if_exclue MCA
     parameters to select exactly which OpenFabrics devices to use in
     your MPI job.

Finally, note that the "receive_queues" values may have been set by
the Open MPI device default settings file.  You may want to look in
this file and see if your devices are getting receive_queues values
from this file:

    %s/mca-btl-openib-device-params.ini

Here is more detailed information about the recieive_queus value
conflict:

[eager RDMA and progress threads]
WARNING: The openib BTL was directed to use "eager RDMA" for short

support.  Short eager RDMA is not yet supported with progress threads;
its use has been disabled in this job.  

This is a warning only; you job will attempt to continue.
#
[ptmalloc2 with no threads]
WARNING: It appears that ptmalloc2 was compiled into this process via
-lopenmpi-malloc, but there is no thread support.  This combination is
known to cause memory corruption in the openib BTL.  Open MPI is
therefore disabling the use of the openib BTL in this process for this
run.

[unsupported queues configuration]
The Open MPI receive queue configuration for the OpenFabrics devices
on two nodes are incompatible, meaning that MPI processes on two
specific nodes were unable to communicate with each other.  This
generally happens when you are using OpenFabrics devices from
different vendors on the same network.  You should be able to use the
mca_btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter to set a uniform receive
queue configuration for all the devices in the MPI job, and therefore
be able to run successfully.

[reg mem limit low]
WARNING: It appears that your OpenFabrics subsystem is configured to only
allow registering part of your physical memory.  This can cause MPI jobs to
run with erratic performance, hang, and/or crash.

This may be caused by your OpenFabrics vendor limiting the amount of
physical memory that can be registered.  You should investigate the
relevant Linux kernel module parameters that control how much physical
memory can be registered, and increase them to allow registering all
physical memory on your machine.

See this Open MPI FAQ item for more information on these Linux kernel module
parameters:
