.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.ft R
.TP 1i
comm
Communicator with Cartesian structure (handle).
.TP 1i
remain_dims
The ith entry of remain_dims specifies whether the ith dimension is kept in the subgrid (true) or is dropped (false) (logical vector).

.SH OUTPUT PARAMETERS
.ft R
.TP 1i
comm_new
Communicator containing the subgrid that includes the calling process (handle).
.ft R
.TP 1i
IERROR
Fortran only: Error status (integer). 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
If a Cartesian topology has been created with MPI_Cart_create, the function  MPI_Cart_sub can be used to partition the communicator group into subgroups that form lower-dimensional Cartesian subgrids, and to build for each subgroup a communicator with the associated subgrid Cartesian topology. (This function is closely related to MPI_Comm_split.) 
.sp
\fBExample:\fP Assume that  MPI_Cart_create( \&..., comm) has defined a (2 x 3 x 4)   grid. Let  remain_dims = (true, false, true). Then a call to 
.sp
.nf
    MPI_Cart_sub(comm, remain_dims, comm_new) 
.fi
.sp
will create three communicators, each with eight processes in a 2 x 4 Cartesian topology. If remain_dims = (false, false, true) then the call to MPI_Cart_sub(comm, remain_dims, comm_new) will create six nonoverlapping communicators, each with four processes, in a one-dimensional Cartesian topology.

.SH ERRORS
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument. C++ functions do not return errors. If the default error handler is set to MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS, then on error the C++ exception mechanism will be used to throw an MPI:Exception object.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
