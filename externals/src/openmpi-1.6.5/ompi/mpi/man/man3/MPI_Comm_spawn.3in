.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
MPI_Comm_spawn tries to start \fImaxprocs\fP identical copies of the MPI program specified by \fIcommand\fP, establishing communication with them and returning an intercommunicator. The spawned processes are referred to as children. The children have their own MPI_COMM_WORLD, which is separate from that of the parents. MPI_Comm_spawn is collective over \fIcomm\fP, and also may not return until MPI_Init has been called in the children. Similarly, MPI_Init in the children may not return until all parents have called MPI_Comm_spawn. In this sense, MPI_Comm_spawn in the parents and MPI_Init in the children form a collective operation over the union of parent and child processes. The intercommunicator returned by MPI_Comm_spawn contains the parent processes in the local group and the child processes in the remote group. The ordering of processes in the local and remote groups is the same as the as the ordering of the group of the \fIcomm\fP in the parents and of MPI_COMM_WORLD of the children, respectively. This intercommunicator can be obtained in the children through the function MPI_Comm_get_parent. 
.sp
The MPI standard allows an implementation to use the MPI_UNIVERSE_SIZE attribute of MPI_COMM_WORLD to specify the number of processes that will be active in a program.  Although this implementation of the MPI standard defines MPI_UNIVERSE_SIZE, it does not allow the user to set its value.  If you try to set the value of MPI_UNIVERSE_SIZE, you will get an error message.
.sp
The \fIcommand\fP Argument 
.sp
The \fIcommand\fP argument is a string containing the name of a program to be spawned. The string is null-terminated in C. In Fortran, leading and trailing spaces are stripped. MPI looks for the file first in the working directory of the spawning process. 
.sp
The \fIargv\fP Argument
.sp
\fIargv\fP is an array of strings containing arguments that are passed
to the program. The first element of \fIargv\fP is the first argument
passed to \fIcommand\fP, not, as is conventional in some contexts, the
command itself. The argument list is terminated by NULL in C and C++
and an empty string in Fortran (note that it is the MPI application's
responsibility to ensure that the last entry of the 
.I argv 
array is an empty string; the compiler will not automatically insert
it). In Fortran, leading and trailing spaces are always stripped, so
that a string consisting of all spaces is considered an empty
string. The constant MPI_ARGV_NULL may be used in C, C++ and Fortran
to indicate an empty argument list. In C and C++, this constant is the
same as NULL.
.sp
In C, the MPI_Comm_spawn argument \fIargv\fP differs from the \fIargv\fP argument of \fImain\fP in two respects. First, it is shifted by one element. Specifically, \fIargv\fP[0] of \fImain\fP  contains the name of the program (given by \fIcommand\fP). \fIargv\fP[1] of \fImain\fP corresponds to \fIargv\fP[0] in MPI_Comm_spawn, \fIargv\fP[2] of \fImain\fP to \fIargv\fP[1] of MPI_Comm_spawn, and so on. Second, \fIargv\fP of MPI_Comm_spawn must be null-terminated, so that its length can be determined. Passing an \fIargv\fP of MPI_ARGV_NULL to MPI_Comm_spawn results in \fImain\fP receiving \fIargc\fP of 1 and an \fIargv\fP whose element 0 is the name of the program. 
.sp
The \fImaxprocs\fP Argument
.sp
Open MPI tries to spawn \fImaxprocs\fP processes. If it is unable to spawn \fImaxprocs\fP processes, it raises an error of class MPI_ERR_SPAWN. If MPI is able to spawn the specified number of processes, MPI_Comm_spawn returns successfully and the number of spawned processes, \fIm\fP, is given by the size of the remote group of \fIintercomm\fP.
.sp
A spawn call with the default behavior is called hard. A spawn call for which fewer than \fImaxprocs\fP processes may be returned is called soft. 
.sp
The \fIinfo\fP Argument 
.sp
The \fIinfo\fP argument is an opaque handle of type MPI_Info in C, MPI::Info in C++ and INTEGER in Fortran. It is a container for a number of user-speci ed (\fIkey,value\fP) pairs. \fIkey\fP and \fIvalue\fP are strings (null-terminated char* in C, character*(*) in Fortran). Routines to create and manipulate the \fIinfo\fP argument are described in Section 4.10 of the MPI-2 standard. 
.sp
For the SPAWN calls, \fIinfo\fP provides additional, implementation-dependent instructions to MPI and the runtime system on how to start processes. An application may pass MPI_INFO_NULL in C or Fortran. Portable programs not requiring detailed control over process locations should use MPI_INFO_NULL.
.sp
The following keys for \fIinfo\fP are recognized in Open MPI. (The reserved values mentioned in Section 5.3.4 of the MPI-2 standard are not implemented.)

---                             ----      -----------

host                            char *    Host on which the process should be spawned.
                                          See the \fIorte_host\fP man page for an
                                          explanation of how this will be used.
hostfile                        char *    Hostfile containing the hosts on which
                                          the processes are to be spawned. See
                                          the \fIorte_hostfile\fP man page for an
                                          explanation of how this will be used.
add-host                        char *    Add the specified host to the list of
                                          hosts known to this job and use it
                                          for the associated process. This will
                                          be used similarly to the -host option.
add-hostfile                    char *    Hostfile containing hosts to be added
                                          to the list of hosts known to this job and
                                          use it for the associated process. This will
                                          be used similarly to the -hostfile option.
wdir                            char *    Directory where the executable is located. If
                                          files are to be pre-positioned, then this
                                          location is the desired working directory
                                          at time of execution - if not specified,
                                          then it will automatically be set to
                                          \fIompi_preload_files_dest_dir\fP.
ompi_prefix                     char *    Same as the --prefix command line argument
                                          to mpirun.
ompi_local_slave                bool      If set to true, launch the specified process
                                          as a local \fIslave\fP to the calling process.
                                          The new process will only be known to the caller,
                                          and will only be able to communicate with the caller.
ompi_preload_binary             bool      If set to true, pre-position the specified
                                          executable onto the remote host. A destination
                                          directory must also be provided.
ompi_preload_files_dest_dir     char *    Target directory where pre-positioned files
                                          are to be placed.
ompi_preload_files              char *    A comma-separated list of files that are to
                                          be pre-positioned in addition to the executable.
                                          Note that this option does not depend upon
                                          \fIompi_preload_binary\fP - files can be moved
                                          to the target even if an executable is not moved.
ompi_preload_files_src_dir      char *    Source directory where files and executables
                                          that are to be pre-positioned can be found. If
                                          not specified, the current working directory
                                          will be used.
ompi_non_mpi                    bool      If set to true, launching a non-MPI
                                          application; the returned communicator
                                          will be MPI_COMM_NULL. Failure to set
                                          this flag when launching a non-MPI
                                          application will cause both the child
                                          and parent jobs to "hang".
ompi_param                      char *    Pass an OMPI MCA parameter to the child job.
                                          If that parameter already exists in the
                                          environment, the value will be overwritten
                                          by the provided value.
map_bynode                      bool      If set to true, the processes are mapped bynode.
                                          If set to false, the processes are mapped byslot.
                                          By default, mapping is determined by the default
                                          mapping policy set when the job was started.

\fIbool\fP info keys are actually strings but are evaluated as
follows: if the string value is a number, it is converted to an
integer and cast to a boolean (meaning that zero integers are false
and non-zero values are true).  If the string value is
(case-insensitive) "yes" or "true", the boolean is true.  If the
string value is (case-insensitive) "no" or "false", the boolean is
false.  All other string values are unrecognized, and therefore false.
  
.sp
The \fIroot\fP Argument
.sp
All arguments before the \fIroot\fP argument are examined only on the process whose rank in \fIcomm\fP is equal to \fIroot\fP. The value of these arguments on other processes is ignored. 
.sp
The \fIarray_of_errcodes\fP Argument
.sp
The \fIarray_of_errcodes\fP is an array of length \fImaxprocs\fP in which MPI reports the status of the processes that MPI was requested to start. If all \fImaxprocs\fP processes were spawned, \fIarray_of_errcodes\fP is filled in with the value MPI_SUCCESS. If anyof the processes are \fInot\fP spawned, \fIarray_of_errcodes\fP is filled in with the value MPI_ERR_SPAWN. In C or Fortran, an application may pass MPI_ERRCODES_IGNORE if it is not interested in the error codes. In C++ this constant does not exist, and the \fIarray_of_errcodes\fP argument may be omitted from the argument list. 

.SH NOTES
.ft R
Completion of MPI_Comm_spawn in the parent does not necessarily mean that MPI_Init has been called in the children (although the returned intercommunicator can be used immediately). 


.SH ERRORS
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument. C++ functions do not return errors. If the default error handler is set to MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS, then on error the C++ exception mechanism will be used to throw an MPI:Exception object.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
