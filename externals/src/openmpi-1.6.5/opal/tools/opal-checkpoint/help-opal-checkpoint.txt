%s

[invalid_pid]
Error: The PID (%d) is invalid because either you have not provided a PID 
       or provided an invalid PID.
       Please see --help for usage.

[ckpt_failure]
Error: The application (PID = %d) failed to checkpoint properly.
       Returned %d, state %d.

[restart_cmd_failure]
Error: Unable to obtain the proper restart command to restart from the 
       checkpoint file (%s). Returned %d.

[pid_does_not_exist]
Error: The process with PID %d is not checkpointable.
       This could be due to one of the following:
        - An application with this PID doesn't currently exist
        - The application with this PID isn't checkpointable
        - The application with this PID isn't an OPAL application.
       We were looking for the named files:
         %s
         %s
[ckpt:in_progress]
The process with PID %d is currently not checkpointable.
This is because it is already checkpointing itself.
Wait until the checkpoint completes then try again.
[ckpt:req_error]
The process with PID %d is currently not checkpointable.
This is due to an error during the checkpointing process.
[ckpt:req_null]
The process with PID %d is not checkpointable.
This can be due to one of the following reasons:
 - The process was compiled without checkpoint support
 - The process has elected not to be checkpointable by
   using unsupported functions.
 - The process has elected not to be checkpointable due
   to the lack of a checkpoint/restart system.
