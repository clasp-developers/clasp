\f0\fs24 \cf0 Open MPI is a project combining technologies and resources from several other projects ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://icl.cs.utk.edu/ftmpi/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 FT-MPI}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://public.lanl.gov/lampi/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 LA-MPI}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.lam-mpi.org/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 LAM/MPI}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.hlrs.de/organization/pds/projects/pacx-mpi/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 PACX-MPI}}) in order to build the best MPI library available. A completely new MPI-2 compliant implementation, Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, application developers and computer science researchers.

\cf0 \ul \ulc0 Special OS X Package Notes\ulnone \
\
The binary package for Open MPI includes support for TCP and shared memory transports, with rsh/ssh and XGrid job launching.  Sites requiring support for other networks or job launching mechanisms will need to rebuild from source.\
\
There is no Fortran support in this binary package, as Apple does not ship a Fortran compiler with the Developer Tools - if you have a Fortran compiler and need Fortran support from Open MPI, you will have to build it from source.\
\
Because HFS+ is case-preserving but not case-sensitive, the C++ wrapper compiler is named mpic++, not the traditional mpiCC (which would conflict with mpicc).\
