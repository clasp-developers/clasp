===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of Open MPI since
version 1.0.

As more fully described in the "Software Version Number" section in
the README file, Open MPI typically releases two separate version
series simultaneously.  Since these series have different goals and
are semi-independent of each other, a single NEWS-worthy item may be
introduced into different series at different times.  For example,
feature F was introduced in the vA.B series at version vA.B.C, and was
later introduced into the vX.Y series at vX.Y.Z.

The first time feature F is released, the item will be listed in the
vA.B.C section, denoted as:

   (** also to appear: X.Y.Z) -- indicating that this item is also
                                 likely to be included in future release
                                 version vX.Y.Z.

When vX.Y.Z is later released, the same NEWS-worthy item will also be
included in the vX.Y.Z section and be denoted as:

   (** also appeared: A.B.C)  -- indicating that this item was previously
                                 included in release version vA.B.C.

  profiling interface, it essentially prints out to stderr when select
  MPI functions are invoked.
- Update bundled VampirTrace to v5.8.2.
- Add pkg-config(1) configuration files for ompi, ompi-c, ompi-cxx,

1.4
---

The *only* change in the Open MPI v1.4 release (as compared to v1.3.4)
was to update the embedded version of Libtool's libltdl to address a
potential security vulnerability.  Specifically: Open MPI v1.3.4 was
created with GNU Libtool 2.2.6a; Open MPI v1.4 was created with GNU
Libtool 2.2.6b.  There are no other changes between Open MPI v1.3.4
and v1.4.


1.3.4
-----

- Allow the overriding RFC1918 and RFC3330 for the specification of
  "private" networks, thereby influencing Open MPI's TCP
  "reachability" computations.

  shared memory progression rules and by enabling the "sync" collective
  to barrier every 1,000th collective.
- Various fixes for the IBM XL C/C++ v10.1 compiler.
- Allow explicit disabling of ptmalloc2 hooks at runtime (e.g., enable
  support for Debian's builtroot system).  Thanks to Manuel Prinz and

  http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/announce/2009/03/0029.php.
  Open MPI now uses a much more robust memory intercept scheme that is
  quite similar to what is used by MX.  The use of "-lopenmpi-malloc"
  is no longer necessary, is deprecated, and is expected to disappear
  in a future release.  -lopenmpi-malloc will continue to work for the
  duration of the Open MPI v1.3 and v1.4 series.
- Fix some OpenFabrics shutdown errors, both regarding iWARP and SRQ.
- Allow the udapl BTL to work on Solaris platforms that support
  relaxed PCI ordering.
- Fix problem where the mpirun would sometimes use rsh/ssh to launch on
  the localhost (instead of simply forking).
- Minor SLURM stdin fixes.
- Fix to run properly under SGE jobs.
- Scalability and latency improvements for shared memory jobs: convert
  to using one message queue instead of N queues.
- Automatically size the shared-memory area (mmap file) to match
  better what is needed;  specifically, so that large-np jobs will start.
- Use fixed-length MPI predefined handles in order to provide ABI
  compatibility between Open MPI releases.
- Fix building of the posix paffinity component to properly get the
  number of processors in loosely tested environments (e.g.,
  FreeBSD).  Thanks to Steve Kargl for reporting the issue.
- Fix --with-libnuma handling in configure.  Thanks to Gus Correa for
  reporting the problem.


1.3.1
-----

  leading to compile problems on some platforms.  Thanks to Andrea Iob
  for the bug report.
- Fix mca_btl_openib_warn_no_device_params_found MCA parameter; it
  was accidentally being ignored.

- Increased the size of MPI_MAX_PORT_NAME to 1024 from 36. See ticket #1533.
- Added "notify debugger on abort" feature. See tickets #1509 and #1510.
  Thanks to Seppo Sahrakropi for the bug report.
- Upgraded Open MPI tarballs to use Autoconf 2.63, Automake 1.10.1,
  Libtool 2.2.6a.
- Added missing MPI::Comm::Call_errhandler() function.  Thanks to Dave
  Goodell for bringing this to our attention.
- Increased MPI_SUBVERSION value in mpi.h to 1 (i.e., MPI 2.1).
- Changed behavior of MPI_GRAPH_CREATE, MPI_TOPO_CREATE, and several
  other topology functions per MPI-2.1.
- Fix the type of the C++ constant MPI::IN_PLACE.
- Various enhancements to the openib BTL:
  - Added btl_openib_if_[in|ex]clude MCA parameters for
    including/excluding comma-delimited lists of HCAs and ports.
  - Added RDMA CM support, includng btl_openib_cpc_[in|ex]clude MCA
    parameters
  - Added NUMA support to only use "near" network adapters
  - Added "Bucket SRQ" (BSRQ) support to better utilize registered
    memory, including btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter
  - Added ConnectX XRC support (and integrated with BSRQ)
  - Added btl_openib_ib_max_inline_data MCA parameter
  - Added iWARP support
  - Revamped flow control mechansisms to be more efficient
  - "mpi_leave_pinned=1" is now the default when possible,
    automatically improving performance for large messages when
    application buffers are re-used
- Elimiated duplicated error messages when multiple MPI processes fail
  with the same error.
- Added NUMA support to the shared memory BTL.
- Add Valgrind-based memory checking for MPI-semantic checks.
- Add support for some optional Fortran datatypes (MPI_LOGICAL1,
  MPI_LOGICAL2, MPI_LOGICAL4 and MPI_LOGICAL8).
- Remove the use of the STL from the C++ bindings.
- Added support for Platform/LSF job launchers.  Must be Platform LSF
  v7.0.2 or later.
- Updated ROMIO with the version from MPICH2 1.0.7.
- Added RDMA capable one-sided component (called rdma), which
  can be used with BTL components that expose a full one-sided
  interface.
- Added the optional datatype MPI_REAL2. As this is added to the "end of"
  predefined datatypes in the fortran header files, there will not be
  any compatibility issues.
- Added Portable Linux Processor Affinity (PLPA) for Linux.
- Addition of a finer symbols export control via the visibiliy feature
  offered by some compilers.
- Added checkpoint/restart process fault tolerance support. Initially
  support a LAM/MPI-like protocol.
- Removed "mvapi" BTL; all InfiniBand support now uses the OpenFabrics
  driver stacks ("openib" BTL).
- Added more stringent MPI API parameter checking to help user-level
  debugging.
- The ptmalloc2 memory manager component is now by default built as
  a standalone library named libopenmpi-malloc.  Users wanting to
  use leave_pinned with ptmalloc2 will now need to link the library
  into their application explicitly.  All other users will use the
  libc-provided allocator instead of Open MPI's ptmalloc2.  This change
  may be overriden with the configure option enable-ptmalloc2-internal
- The leave_pinned options will now default to using mallopt on
  Linux in the cases where ptmalloc2 was not linked in.  mallopt
  will also only be available if munmap can be intercepted (the
  default whenever Open MPI is not compiled with --without-memory-
  manager.
- Open MPI will now complain and refuse to use leave_pinned if
  no memory intercept / mallopt option is available.
- Add option of using Perl-based wrapper compilers instead of the
  C-based wrapper compilers.  The Perl-based version does not
  have the features of the C-based version, but does work better
  in cross-compile environments.

  This reduces communication latency over IB channels.
- Numerous performance improvements throughout the entire code base.
- Many minor threading fixes.
- Add a define OMPI_SKIP_CXX to allow the user to skip the mpicxx.h from

  ability to background mpirun and a loss of data issue when
  redirecting mpirun's standard input from a file.
- Fixed bug in ompi_info where rcache and bml MCA parameters would not
  be displayed.
- Fixed umask issues in the session directory.  Thanks to Glenn Morris
  for reporting this to us.
- Fixed tcsh-based LD_LIBRARY_PATH issues with --prefix.  Thanks to
  Glen Morris for identifying the problem and suggesting the fix.
- Removed extraneous \n's when setting PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the
  rsh startup.  Thanks to Glen Morris for finding these typos.
- Fixed missing constants in MPI C++ bindings.
- Fixed some errors caused by threading issues.
- Fixed openib BTL flow control logic to not overrun the number of
  send wqes available.
- Update to match newest OpenIB user-level library API.  Thanks to
  Roland Dreier for submitting this patch.
- Report errors properly when failing to register memory in the openib
  BTL.
- Reduce memory footprint of openib BTL.
- Fix parsing problem with mpirun's "-tv" switch.  Thanks to Chris
  Gottbrath for supplying the fix.
- Fix Darwin net/if.h configure warning.
- The GNU assembler unbelievably defaults to making stacks executable.
  So when using gas, add flags to explicitly tell it to not make
  stacks executable (lame but necessary).
- Add missing MPI::Request::Get_status() methods.  Thanks to Bill
  Saphir for pointing this out to us.
- Improved error messages on memory registration errors (e.g., when
  using high-speed networks).
- Open IB support now checks firmware for how many outstanding RDMA
  requests are supported.  Thanks to Mellanox for pointing this out to
  us.
- Enable printing of stack traces in MPI processes upon SIGBUS,
  SIGSEGV, and SIGFPE if the platform supports it.
- Fixed F90 compilation support for the Lahey compiler.
- Fixed issues with ROMIO shared library support.
- Fixed internal accounting problems with rsh support.
- Update to GNU Libtool 1.5.22.
- Fix error in configure script when setting CCAS to ias (the Intel
  assembler).
- Added missing MPI::Intercomm collectives.
- Fixed MPI_IN_PLACE handling for Fortran collectives.
- Fixed some more C++ const_cast<> issues.  Thanks for Martin Audet
  (again) for bringing this to our attention.
- Updated ROMIO with the version from MPICH 1.2.7p1, marked as version
  2005-06-09.
- Fixes for some cases where the use of MPI_BOTTOM could cause
  problems.
- Properly handle the case where an mVAPI does not have shared receive
  queue support (such as the one shipped by SilverStorm / Infinicon
  for OS X).


1.0.1
-----

- Fixed assembly on Solaris AMD platforms.  Thanks to Pierre Valiron
  for bringing this to our attention.
- Fixed long messages in the send-to-self case.
- Ensure that when the "leave_pinned" option is used, the memory hooks
  are also enabled.  Thanks to Gleb Natapov for pointing this out.
- Fixed compile errors for IRIX.
- Allow hostfiles to have integer host names (for BProc clusters).
- Fixed a problem with message matching of out-of-order fragments in
  multiple network device scenarios.
- Converted all the C++ MPI bindings to use proper const_cast<>'s
  instead of old C-style casts to get rid of const-ness.  Thanks to
  Martin Audet for raising the issue with us.
- Converted MPI_Offset to be a typedef instead of a #define because it
  causes problems for some C++ parsers.  Thanks to Martin Audet for
  bringing this to our attention.
- Improved latency of TCP BTL.
- Fixed index value in MPI_TESTANY to be MPI_UNDEFINED if some
  requests were not MPI_REQUEST_NULL, but no requests finished.
- Fixed several Fortran MPI API implementations that incorrectly used
  integers instead of logicals or address-sized integers.
- Fix so that Open MPI correctly handles the Fortran value for .TRUE.,
  regardless of what the Fortran compiler's value for .TRUE. is.
- Improved scalability of MX startup.
- Fix datatype offset handling in the coll basic component's
  MPI_SCATTERV implementation.
- Fix EOF handling on stdin.
- Fix missing MPI_F_STATUS_IGNORE and MPI_F_STATUSES_IGNORE
  instanatiations.  Thanks to Anthony Chan for pointing this out.
- Add a missing value for MPI_WIN_NULL in mpif.h.
- Bring over some fixes for the sm btl that somehow didn't make it
  over from the trunk before v1.0.  Thanks to Beth Tibbitts and Bill
  Chung for helping identify this issue.
- Bring over some fixes for the iof that somehow didn't make it over
  from the trunk before v1.0.
- Fix for --with-wrapper-ldflags handling.  Thanks to Dries Kimpe for
  pointing this out to us.
