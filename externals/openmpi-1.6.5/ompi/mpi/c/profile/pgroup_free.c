       http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2007/12/2750.php

       The short version: other MPI's allow it (LAM/MPI, CT6, MPICH2)
       probably mainly because the Intel MPI test suite expects it to
       happen and there's now several years worth of expected behavior
       to allow this behavior.  Rather than have to explain every time
       why OMPI is the only one who completely adheres to the standard
       / fails the intel tests, it seemed easier to just let this one
       slide.  It's not really that important, after all! */
