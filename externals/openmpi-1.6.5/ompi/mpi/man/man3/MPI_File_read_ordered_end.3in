.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
MPI_File_read_ordered_end is the ending part of a split collective routine that must be called by all processes in the communicator group associated with the
file handle 
.I fh. 
MPI_File_rad_ordered_end blocks until the operation initiated by MPI_File_read_ordered_begin completes. It attempts to read the file associated with 
.I fh
into the user's buffer 
.I buf.
The shared file pointer is updated by the amounts of data requested by all processes of the group. For each process, the location in the file at which data is read is the position at which the shared file pointer would be after all processes whose ranks within the group are less than that of this process had read their data. 

.SH NOTES
.ft R
All the nonblocking collective routines for data access are "split" into two routines, each with _begin or _end as a suffix. These split collective routines are subject to the semantic rules described in Section 9.4.5 of the MPI-2 standard. 

.SH ERRORS
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument. C++ functions do not return errors. If the default error handler is set to MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS, then on error the C++ exception mechanism will be used to throw an MPI:Exception object.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. For MPI I/O function errors, the default error handler is set to MPI_ERRORS_RETURN. The error handler may be changed with MPI_File_set_errhandler; the predefined error handler MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL may be used to make I/O errors fatal. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
