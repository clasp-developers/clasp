.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.ft R
.TP 1i
count
Lists length (integer).
.TP 1i
array_of_requests
Array of requests (array of handles).

.SH OUTPUT PARAMETERS
.ft R
.TP 1i
flag
True if previously initiated communications are complete (logical.)
.TP 1i
array_of_statuses
Array of status objects (array of status).
.ft R
.TP 1i
IERROR
Fortran only: Error status (integer). 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
Returns \fIflag\fP = true if all communications associated with active handles in the array have completed (this includes the case where no handle in the list is active). In this case, each status entry that corresponds to an active handle request is set to the status of the corresponding communication; if the request was allocated by a nonblocking communication call then it is deallocated, and the handle is set to MPI_REQUEST_NULL. Each status entry that corresponds to a null or inactive handle is set to empty.
.sp
Otherwise, \fIflag\fP = false is returned, no request is modified and the values of the status entries are undefined. This is a local operation.
.sp
If your application does not need to examine the \fIarray_of_statuses\fP field, you can save resources by using the predefined constant MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE can be used as a special value for the \fIarray_of_statuses\fP argument. 
.sp
Errors that occurred during the execution of MPI_Testall are handled in the same manner as errors in MPI_Waitall.

.SH NOTE
.ft R
\fIflag\fP is true only if all requests have completed. Otherwise, \fIflag\fP is false,
and neither \fIarray_of_requests\fP nor \fIarray_of_statuses\fP is modified.

.SH ERRORS
For each invocation of MPI_Testall, if one or more requests generate
an MPI exception, only the \fIfirst\fP MPI request that caused an
exception will be passed to its corresponding error handler.  No other
error handlers will be invoked (even if multiple requests generated
exceptions).  However, \fIall\fP requests that generate an exception
will have a relevant error code set in the corresponding
status.MPI_ERROR field (unless MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE was used).
.sp
The default error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function
errors. The error handler may be changed with MPI_Comm_set_errhandler,
MPI_File_set_errhandler, or MPI_Win_set_errhandler (depending on the
type of MPI handle that generated the MPI request); the predefined
error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to
be returned. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can
continue past an error.
.sp
If the invoked error handler allows MPI_Testall to return to the
caller, the value MPI_ERR_IN_STATUS will be returned in the C and
Fortran bindings.  In C++, if the predefined error handler
MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS is used, the value MPI::ERR_IN_STATUS
will be contained in the MPI::Exception object.  The MPI_ERROR field
can then be examined in the array of returned statuses to determine
exactly which request(s) generated an exception.
