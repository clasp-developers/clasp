/**
 * Shared memory barrier.
 *
 * Tree-based algorithm for a barrier: a fan in to rank 0 followed by
 * a fan out using the barrier segments in the shared memory area.
 *
 * There are 2 sets of barrier buffers -- since there can only be, at
 * most, 2 outstanding barriers at any time, there is no need for more
 * than this.  The generalized in-use flags, control, and data
 * segments are not used.
 *
 * The general algorithm is for a given process to wait for its N
 * children to fan in by monitoring a uint32_t in its barrier "in"
 * buffer.  When this value reaches N (i.e., each of the children have
 * atomically incremented the value), then the process atomically
 * increases the uint32_t in its parent's "in" buffer.  Then the
 * process waits for the parent to set a "1" in the process' "out"
 * buffer.  Once this happens, the process writes a "1" in each of its
 * children's "out" buffers, and returns.
 *
 * There's corner cases, of course, such as the root that has no
 * parent, and the leaves that have no children.  But that's the
 * general idea.
