# This is the default NIC/HCA parameters file for Open MPI's OpenIB
# BTL.  If NIC/HCA vendors wish to add their respective values into
# this file (that is distributed with Open MPI), please contact the
# Open MPI development team.  See http://www.open-mpi.org/ for
# details.

# This file is in the "ini" style, meaning that it has sections
# identified section names enclosed in square brackets (e.g.,
# "[Section name]") followed by "key = value" pairs indicating values
# for a specific NIC/HCA vendor and model.  NICs/HCAs are identified
# by their vendor ID and vendor part ID, which can be obtained by
# running the diagnostic utility command "ibv_devinfo".  The fields
# "vendor_id" and "vendor_part"id" are the vendor ID and vendor part
# ID, respectively.

# The sections in this file only accept a few fields:

# vendor_id: a comma-delimited list of integers of NIC/HCA vendor IDs,
# expressed either in decimal or hexidecimal (e.g., "13" or "0xd").
# Individual values can be taken directly from the output of
# "ibv_devinfo".  NIC/HCA vendor ID's correspond to IEEE OUI's, for
# which you can find the canonical list here:
# http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/.  Example:
#
#     vendor_id = 0x05ad
#
# Note: Several vendors resell Mellanox hardware and put their own firmware
# on the cards, therefore overriding the default Mellanox vendor ID.
#
#     Mellanox      0x02c9
#     Cisco         0x05ad
#     Silverstorm   0x066a
#     Voltaire      0x08f1
#     HP            0x1708
#     Sun           0x03ba
#     Bull          0x119f

# vendor_part_id: a comma-delimited list of integers of different
# NIC/HCA models from a single vendor, expressed in either decimal or
# hexidecimal (e.g., "13" or "0xd").  Individual values can be
# obtained from the output of the "ibv_devinfo".  Example:
#
#     vendor_part_id = 25208,25218

# mtu: an integer indicating the maximum transfer unit (MTU) to be
# used with this NIC/HCA.  The effective MTU will be the minimum of an
# NIC's/HCA's MTU value and its peer NIC's/HCA's MTU value.  Valid
# values are 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096.  Example:
#
#    mtu = 1024

# use_eager_rdma: an integer indicating whether RDMA should be used
# for eager messages.  0 values indicate "no" (false); non-zero values
# indicate "yes" (true).  This flag should only be enabled for
# NICs/HCAs that can provide guarantees about ordering of data in
# memory -- that the last byte of an incoming RDMA write will always
# be written last.  Certain cards cannot provide this guarantee, while
# others can.

#    use_eager_rdma = 1

# receive_queues: a list of "bucket shared receive queues" (BSRQ) that
# are opened between MPI process peer pairs for point-to-point
# communications of messages shorter than the total length required
# for RDMA transfer.  The use of multiple RQs, each with different
# sized posted receive buffers can allow [much] better registered
# memory utilization -- MPI messages are sent on the QP with the
# smallest buffer size that will fit the message.  Note that flow
# control messages are always sent across the QP with the smallest
# buffer size.  Also note that the buffers *must* be listed in
# increasing buffer size.  This parameter matches the
# mca_btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter; see the ompi_info help
# message and FAQ for a description of its values.  BSRQ
# specifications are found in this precedence:

# highest: specifying the mca_btl_openib_receive_queues MCA param
# next:    finding a value in this file
# lowest:  using the default mca_btl_openib_receive_queues MCA param value

#    receive_queues = P,128,256,192,128:S,65536,256,192,128

# max_inline_data: an integer specifying the maximum inline data (in
# bytes) supported by the device.  -1 means to use a run-time probe to
# figure out the maximum value supported by the device.

#    max_inline_data = 1024

# rdmacm_reject_causes_connect_error: a boolean indicating whether
# when an RDMA CM REJECT is issued on the device, instead of getting
# the expected REJECT event back, you might get a CONNECT_ERROR event.
# Open MPI uses RDMA CM REJECT messages in its normal wireup
# procedure; some connections are *expected* to be rejected.  However,
# with some older drivers, if process A issues a REJECT, process B
# will receive a CONNECT_ERROR event instead of a REJECT event.  So if
# this flag is set to true and we receive a CONNECT_ERROR event on a
# connection where we are expecting a REJECT, then just treat the
# CONNECT_ERROR exactly as we would have treated the REJECT.  Setting
# this flag to true allows Open MPI to work around the behavior
# described above.  It is [mostly] safe to set this flag to true even
# after a driver has been fixed; the scope of where this flag is used
# is small enough that it *shouldn't* mask real CONNECT_ERROR events.

#    rdmacm_reject_causes_connect_error = 1
