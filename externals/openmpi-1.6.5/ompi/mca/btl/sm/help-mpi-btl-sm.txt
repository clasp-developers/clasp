# This is the US/English help file for Open MPI's shared memory support.
#
[knem requested but not supported]
WARNING: Linux kernel knem support was requested for the shared memory
(sm) BTL, but it is not supported.  Deactivating the shared memory
BTL.

  Local host: %s
#
[knem permission denied]
Open MPI failed to open the /dev/knem device due to a permissions
problem.  Please check with your system administrator to get the
permissions fixed, or set the btl_sm_use_knem MCA parameter to 0 to
run without /dev/knem support.

  Local host:            %s
  /dev/knem permissions: 0%o
#
[knem fail open]
Open MPI failed to open the /dev/knem device due to a local error.
Please check with your system administrator to get the problem fixed,
or set the btl_sm_use_knem MCA parameter to 0 to run without /dev/knem
support.

  Local host: %s
  Errno:      %d (%s)
#
[knem get ABI fail]
Open MPI failed to retrieve the ABI version from the /dev/knem device
due to a local error.  This usually indicates an error in your
/dev/knem installation; please check with your system administrator,
or set the btl_sm_use_knem MCA parameter to 0 to run without /dev/knem
support.

  Local host: %s
  Errno:      %d (%s)
#
[knem ABI mismatch]
Open MPI was compiled with support for one version of the knem kernel
module, but it discovered a different version running in /dev/knem.
Open MPI needs to be installed with support for the same version of
knem as is in the running Linux kernel.  Please check with your system
administrator, or set the btl_sm_use_knem MCA parameter to 0 to run
without /dev/knem support.

  Local host:              %s
  Open MPI's knem version: 0x%x
  /dev/knem's version:     0x%x
#
[knem mmap fail]
Open MPI failed to map support from the knem Linux kernel module; this
shouldn't happen.  Please check with your system administrator, or set
the btl_sm_use_knem MCA parameter to 0 to run without /dev/knem support.

  Local host:  %s
  System call: mmap()
  Errno:       %d (%s)
#
[knem init error]
Open MPI encountered an error during the knem initialization.  Please
check with your system administrator, or set the btl_sm_use_knem MCA
parameter to 0 to run without /dev/knem support.

  Local host:  %s
  System call: %s
  Errno:       %d (%s)
