# This is the US/English help file for Open MPI MCA op-specific
# error messages. 
#
[op-select:none-available]
Although some op components are available on your system, none of
them said that they could be used for a new MPI_Op ("%s").

This is extremely unusual -- a basic function should always be able to
be selected for any MPI_Op.  As such, this likely means that something
else is wrong with either your Open MPI installation or your system.
#
[op-unselect:failed-finalize]
A op module failed to finalize properly when a MPI_Op that was
using it was destroyed.  

This is somewhat unusual: the module itself may be at fault, or this
may be a symptom of another issue (e.g., a memory problem).
