Please note that this is *NOT* a vanilla 1.2.5.1 distribution of the
ROMIO package from Argonne National Labs.  Various customizations had
to be applied to the configuration process.  More to the point -- if
replace this copy of ROMIO with a newer version, it will likely not
work.  :-(

Local modifications:
====================

- Moved aclocal.m4 -> acinclude.m4
- Bunches of changes in acinclude.m4 to make it work with modern
  versions of the GNU auto tools -- see comments in file.
- Bunches of changes in configure.in to make it work with modern
  versions of the GNU auto tools -- see comments in file.
- Added a full set of Makefile.am files; removed all prior Makefile's;
  replaced most Makefile.in's.  Ignore mpi2-other and man directories.
- We define MPI_MAX_DATAREP_STRING, therefore
  protect the redefinition in include/mpio.h
- Not all systems have snprintf(); include "opal/util/printf.h" in
  test/noncontig_coll.c
