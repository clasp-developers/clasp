.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
\fIorte-clean\fR attempts to clean up any processes and files
left over from Open MPI jobs that were run in the past as well as any
currently running jobs.  This includes OMPI infrastructure and helper
commands, any processes that were spawned as part of the job, and any
temporary files.  orte-clean will only act upon processes and files
that belong to the user running the orte-clean command.  If run as
root, it will kill off processes belonging to any users.
.sp
When run from the command line, orte-clean will attempt to clean up
the local node it is run from.  When launched via mpirun, it will
clean up the nodes selected by mpirun.

.SH EXAMPLES
.ft R
Example 1: Clean up local node only.
.sp
.nf
example% orte-clean
.fi
.sp

Example 2: To clean up on a specific set of nodes specified on
command line, it is recommended to use the pernode option.  This
will run one orte-clean for each node.  
.sp
.nf
example% mpirun --pernode --host node1,node2,node3 orte-clean
.fi
.sp
To clean up on a specific set of nodes from a file.
.sp
.nf
example% mpirun --pernode --hostfile nodes_file orte-clean
.fi
.sp
Example 3: Within a resource managed environment like N1GE,
SLURM, or Torque.  The following example is from N1GE.
.sp
First, we see that we have two nodes with two CPUs each.
.sp
.nf
example% qsh -pe orte 4
.br
example% mpirun -np 4 hostname
.br
node1
.br
node1
.br
node2

.fi
.sp
Clean up all the nodes in the cluster.
.sp
.nf
example% mpirun --pernode orte-clean
.fi
.sp
Clean up a subset of the nodes in the cluster.
.sp
.nf
example% mpirun --pernode --host node1 orte-clean
