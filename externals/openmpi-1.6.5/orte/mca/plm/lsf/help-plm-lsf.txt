[tm-bad-launchid]
The TM (PBS / Torque) process starter cannot spawn the specified
application on a remote node due to an invalid launch_id.

Node name: %s
Launch id: %d

This is most likely due to use of the "--hostfile" option to the
command line. At this time, Open MPI/OpenRTE do not support this
method of operation. Instead, the system expects to directly read
information regarding the nodes to be used from the environment.

Removing "--hostfile" from the command line will likely allow the
application to be launched. This will be fixed in a future release
to support the use of "--hostfile" on the command line.
#
[multiple-prefixes]
Multiple different --prefix options were specified to mpirun for the
same node.  This is a fatal error for the TM (PBS / Torque) process
starter in Open MPI.

The first two prefix values supplied for node %s were:
    %s
and %s
#
[tm-spawn-failed]
The TM (PBS / Torque) process starter failed to spawn a daemon (orted)
on a remote node.

Command line: %s
Node name: %s
Launch id: %d

If you do not understand this error mesage, please try the following:

1. Ensure that the executable "orted" is in your PATH
2. Use the --prefix option to indicate where we can
   find that executable
3. Talk to your local system administrator
