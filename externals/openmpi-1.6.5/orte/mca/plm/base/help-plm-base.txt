[no-available-pls]
No available launching agents were found.

This is an unusual error; it means that Open RTE was unable to find
any mechanism to launch proceses, and therefore is unable to start the
process(es) required by your application.
#
[daemon-died-no-signal]
A daemon (pid %s) died unexpectedly with status %d while attempting
to launch so we are aborting.

There may be more information reported by the environment (see above).

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared
libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.
#
[daemon-died-signal-core]
A daemon (pid %s) died unexpectedly on signal %d (with core) while
attempting to launch so we are aborting.

There may be more information reported by the environment (see above).

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared
libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.

#
[incomplete-exit-cmd]
One or more daemons could not be ordered to exit. This can be caused by a
number of rather rare problems, but typically is caused by a daemon having
died due to the failure of a node or its communications. This could result
in an incomplete cleanup on the affected nodes. Please see below for a list
of nodes which may require additional cleanup.

We are truly sorry for the inconvenience.
#
[incomplete-kill-procs-cmd]
One or more daemons could not be ordered to kill their local processes.
This can be caused by a number of rather rare problems, but typically
is caused by a daemon having died due to the failure of a node or its
communications. This could result in an incomplete cleanup on the affected
nodes. Additional information may be available below.

We are truly sorry for the inconvenience.
#
[stdin-target-out-of-range]
The requested stdin target is out of range for this job - it points
to a process rank that is greater than the number of processes in the
job.

Specified target: %s
Number of procs: %s

This could be caused by specifying a negative number for the stdin
target, or by mistyping the desired rank. Remember that MPI ranks begin
with 0, not 1.

Please correct the cmd line and try again.
#
[too-many-hosts]
A call was made to launch a local slave process, but more than one
target host was provided. Currently, each launch of a local slave
can only be to a single host. To launch slaves on multiple hosts,
you must issue one call/host.

Num hosts specified: %d

#
[abs-path-reqd]
A call was made to launch a local slave process that requested the
binaries be pre-positioned on the remote host. However, an absolute
path to the target directory was either not specified, or was provided
in a relative path format.

Path provided: %s

The path to the target directory must be given as an absolute path. The
target directory does NOT need to exist - the path to the target will
be created, if required.

#
[exec-not-found]
A call was made to launch a local slave process, but the specified
executable could not be found:

Exec: %s

Please either specify an absolute path to the executable, or check
that the executable is in your PATH.

#
[cp-not-found]
A call was made to launch a local slave process that requested the
binaries be pre-positioned on the remote host. However, we could not
find the %s command in your path.

Please check that %s is in your PATH and try again.

#
[file-not-found]
A call was made to launch a local slave process that requested pre-positioning
of one or more files, but the specified files could not be found:

File: %s
Source directory: %s

Please either specify an absolute path to the file, or check
that the file is in your current working directory...and ensure
that you have read permissions on the file.
