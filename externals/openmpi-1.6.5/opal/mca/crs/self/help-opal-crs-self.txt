[self:lt_dlopen]
Error: We were unable to open the executable with libtool.
       We needed to look for the inclusion of user defined callbacks.
       
       Make sure that the linker has exported all of the symbols. 
       This is usally enabled with a flag such as '-export'.

[self:no_callback]
Error: We were unable to find one of the following callbacks:
         %s =  %s_%s
         %s =  %s_%s
         %s =  %s_%s
       Possible causes of this problem are:
        - Linker did not export all of the proper symbols.
          This is usally enabled with a flag such as '-export'.
        - The function does not exist in your program.

       If you have a custom prefix for your functions you may specify
       them with the 'crs_self_prefix' mca parameter. For example,
         $ prog -mca crs_self_prefix my_prefix 
       This will then look for the following functions:
         int my_prefix_checkpoint(void)
         int my_prefix_continue(void)
         int my_prefix_restart(void)
       Otherwise it will search for functions with the default prefix of:
           '%s'

[self:ckpt_disabled]
Error: The checkpointer is currently disabled.
       Unable to proceed with the checkpoint!

[self:no-restart-cmd]
Error: The checkpointer was unable to determine how to restart your
       application. Specify the restart command in the checkpoint
       function.
