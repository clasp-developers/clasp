[sys call fail]
A system call failed during shared memory initialization that should
not have.  It is likely that your MPI job will now either abort or
experience performance degradation.

  Local host:  %s
  System call: %s %s
  Error:       %s (errno %d)

[mmap on nfs]
WARNING: Open MPI will create a shared memory backing file in a
directory that appears to be mounted on a network filesystem.
Creating the shared memory backup file on a network file system, such
as NFS or Lustre is not recommended -- it may cause excessive network
traffic to your file servers and/or cause shared memory traffic in
Open MPI to be much slower than expected.

You may want to check what the typical temporary directory is on your
node.  Possible sources of the location of this temporary directory
include the $TEMPDIR, $TEMP, and $TMP environment variables.

Note, too, that system administrators can set a list of filesystems
where Open MPI is disallowed from creating temporary files by settings
the MCA parameter "orte_no_session_dir".

  Local host: %s
  Fileame:    %s

You can set the MCA paramter shmem_mmap_enable_nfs_warning to 0 to
disable this message.
