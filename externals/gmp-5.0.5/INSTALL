                          INSTALLING GNU MP
                          =================


These instructions are only for the impatient.  Others should read the install
instructions in gmp.info.  Use

	info -f doc/gmp.info

from the gmp source directory.

Here are some brief instructions on how to install GMP.  First you need to
compile.  Since you're impatient, try this

	./configure
	make
	make check		<= VERY IMPORTANT!!

If that fails, or you care about the performance of GMP, you need to read the
full instructions in the chapter "Installing GMP" in the manual.

You should not skip the "make check" part; the risk that the GMP sources are
miscompiled are unfortunately quite high.  And if they indeed are, "make check"
is very likely to trigger the compiler-introduced bug.

Optionally, you can install the library with the following command.  This will
be to /usr/local by default, and you'll probably need to be "root" to be able
to write there.

	make install

To create the printable documentation from the texinfo source, type "make
gmp.dvi" or "make gmp.ps".  This requires various "tex" commands.

If you are new to GMP, it is a good idea you at least read the chapter "GMP
Basics" in the manual.

Some known build problems are noted in the "Installing GMP" chapter of
the manual.  Please report other problems to gmp-bugs@gmplib.org.
